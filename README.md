# Sentiment_Analysis
This is an end-to-end project on sentiment analysis for a movie.

The data was collected from IMDB and Metacritic through the Chrome extension Listly. Four datasets were formatted, preprocessed, and pre-cleaned in Microsoft Excel Power Query. After the datasets were appended together into one dataset in Power Query, the dataset was uploaded into Jupyter Notebook for analysis and the construction of a machine learning algorithm to answer a classification problem. By the end of the analysis, the data was saved into three CSV files so that the data could be properly visualized in Tableau to create a dashboard of some of the findings.
