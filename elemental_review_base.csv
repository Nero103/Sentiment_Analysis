0,1,3.0,6.0,benjaminskylerhill,2023-06-16,"Elemental has several obvious glaring problems. For one thing, the attempt to make the elements' differences an overt metaphor for raceculture is shallow and misplaced at best most of the time.The story's themes and plot itself are about as worn-out and tired as the art of the story itself. Not a single new idea is really explored at this level.And, at the more surface level, the film's visuals vary greatly in quality: the environments are gorgeous, colorful, and vibrant, while the character designs appear haphazard, thrown together, and honestly kind of ugly.But where this film shines-and I mean REALLY shines, surprisingly-is in the writing of its characters.Ember and Wade are instantly distinct, understood, and likeable. They both grow tremendously and at a consistent pace. They are 110% the reason to see this film. I got emotionally wrapped up in their lives and desires in a way that I've only felt in Pixar's best films. This is the sole great achievement of Elemental.The one other thing I can praise is the sound design and the musical score-both of which are largely powerful and memorable.Maybe it's that my expectations were on the floor going into this, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Maybe wait to catch it on streaming, but don't write it off completely.",35
1,2,2.0,3.0,truthisuncouth,2023-06-17,This is a worn out story of recycled material that will bore children. The characters are one dimensional. The scenes are tepid and unexciting. The use of elements to convey human emotion is a nice idea but the execution is not good. The animation was okay but not unique. Certainly nothing to go out of your way for. The depth of the character development seems shallow. The musical score is middling. The editing is choppy. The sound mixing is fair. The scene to scene progression is awkward and the run time is longer than one might expect from the material in the movie. My overall impression is that it can be missed.,64
2,3,2.0,3.0,jamesbond-28264,2023-06-16,"I didn't expect anything from this and i wasn't wrong. Most of the supposed rom-com concepts of the film are not even explored and its mainly used on unfunny jokes and gags that makes the movie feel more like a Illumination film that got mis-branded as a Pixar film. Ember and Wade and most of the characters aren't interesting and they are used for rushed world-building and unfunny character torture jokes, and the ending is the most predictable and generic i ever seen in a animated film. The character design is so ugly and the entire aesthetic of the film is visually gross and it feels like they just focused on making this a self-insert artistic film for the director and they didn't care about what audience would think about it.",45
3,4,3.0,6.0,karim530,2023-06-16,"I don't know where to start with this movie. I expected more from this movie but I was let down. Don't get me wrong, the sweet elements were there especially from the God Father story in the beginning but then it becomes a classic cookie cutter Rom-Com movie with nothing new. Even my eight year old got bored from the first half. The story does improves by the second half but again, I feel PIXAR has lost its magic. I feel that PIXAR is more now about quantity versus quality story telling. The movie had too much visual but lacked to hit home with the story. By the end, my daughter and I were glad the movie was over.",52

6,7,3.0,6.0,annathedehn,2023-06-16,"Elemental is a movie that just doesn't stick out. Pixar made this one a unoriginal story of opposites attacting and families and community not wanting them together. Not much was stuff hadn't seen before. One of the things that did stick out to me was the animation. Nothing mind boggling but it is one of recent Pixar's best work visual wise. I loved how vivid everything was and the elements driving movements. This movie also made laugh multiple times, which for me is pretty good. Some of those laughs however might have just been cope with the cringe, which this movie has a lot of. Some of the movements that characters make in this movie made my face sickle up. This movie entertained me for a bit, just barely though. You could watch better things in your time but if you really want then this movie would be enough to fill a boring night.",30
7,8,4.0,7.0,ajacayen-08856,2023-06-15,"Alongside the release of The Flash, I have never been anticipated to watch a movie in theaters again. And with Elemental, it has proven to give me a great time watching it and has, in a way, revived my love for Pixar films.Ember Lumen was easily the best part of the film because of her struggles in controlling her temper. Her inner conflict between chasing your dreams vs. Family has been a repetitive theme shown in Disney classics but this one hits home for me. Even if my parents were not immigrants, I was able to connect with where she and her family are coming from.For a while, Wade Ripple was an annoying character because of him being a soft guy and crying too much - but that's what also made me like him a lot after watching it. Also, he delivers such romantic lines to Ember that did make me feel kilig at those moments.Speaking of kilig, their romance, while at first did not sit well with me on how they sparked, their pairing was so cute and adorable that it's hard for me to not ship them. And in that relationship, Ember learns a lot about trying things out first and understanding people's differences to reach on a common ground which I thought was pulled off really great.In addition to understanding differences, I loved how they featured the sides of fire and water in order to see how the two families of both Ember and Wade react to their romance - and it was also very relatable for those showing their loved one to the family.Of course, the animation should be talked about because what Pixar has done was absolutely great. With how fire, water, air and wind was animated to such perfection, it is without a doubt deserved to be nominated for Best Animated Feature - even if it's not as amazing as Across the Spider-Verse.As for the story, the first act sets up a lot things very quickly which may need second viewing to get used to it. As it progressed towards the second act, Ember's relationship with both her family and Wade was easily the best part. And how the film wrapped up in its final act, while cheesy, I felt for Wade and Ember's relationship by the end and made me feel great watching it.Overall, it felt great watching Elemental and it is indeed one of those movies that if it comes out on Disney+, I am definitely going to check it out. But I still encourage animation lovers to watch this on the big screen because it's the better experience to enjoy this film.",31
8,9,1.0,2.0,Spamtasticus,2023-06-18,"This is the very first Pixar movie I don't like. I have liked or loved every single one they have released and Brave is my daughter's all time favorite movie from any studio. This movie does not have any of the magic and inventiveness that all other productions have had. We found ourselves mildly entertained and for the first time ever, my daughter went with me to buy something at the concession instead of vehemently staying to not miss a single second of the story. Lasseter might have been lecherous but at least that guy knew how to make good products. Whomever they have in charge of development at Pixar needs to step up their game as Steve Jobs is currently leering at them from the clouds.",20
9,10,2.0,3.0,Father_RIPs,2023-06-20,"Elemental is bad, it's as simple as that. There were a few key issues that are easy to pinpoint, but overall the reason this failed is much more abstract. I think the main issue is that Pixar got in way over their heads. They had this story idea but no real means to animate it, so once they figured out a way to animate it (using 151,000 computer cores), they then had to work around the confines of this massive animation project. And by all means, you can tell this was an issue; cutaways and transitions are awful throughout, and you can tell that the script is majorly rushed to get past this factor; It seemed lazy. Not one character takes a breath in this film before moving on to the next rushed, poorly-written line. Scene after scene with no real meaning and every story element (pun intended) that was supposed to elicit some type of emotional response was given to you in an unsolicited flashback that made no sense. And this created some cringeworthy backstory scenes and dialogue that came out of nowhere. It was quite possibly one of the worst films I have seen in a long time, and it's more heartbreaking that it came from Pixar.Now to be fair to what they've done here, the animation is beautiful, they created a really good-looking animated film, but there was no time to appreciate it due to quick cuts and pointless filler scenes. Once again, Disney and Pixar prioritized the wrong things, taking away from this beautiful feat of animation to create a sloppy pointless story.The voice acting was also sub-par, to say the least. Most of it was average and doesn't make you think twice, except for Ember (Leah Lewis), who really shined, seeming to give real emotion in her lines despite the awful writing. But Wade (Mamoudou Athie) is a different story. His voice was heartless, in my opinion. And again, this may be the script's fault more than the voice acting since Wade was such a boring character who wasn't given a name until halfway through the film (which is insane to think about). We were given a few glimpses of Wade's emotional backstory that could have potentially had some importance to the story, but then the credits roll, and you feel the same way about him at the end as you did in the beginning. He was annoying, and his arc was flatter than the voice acting given for him.I didn't go into this film thinking it was going to be good, but I thought it could be fun. I was proven wrong in a big way. Overall the only redeeming part is its animation which is overshadowed by its story issues. It's worth a watch for the animation alone, but should not be glorified for any other aspect of it (which seems to be what many are doing.",8
10,11,3.0,6.0,Airman87,2023-06-15,"Elemental never really stretches beyond the straightforwardness and banality of its love story - that in a melting pot where desires to maintain our individual ancestral identity paramount all, boundaries and traditions were meant for breaking. In the typical overdone relationship dynamic, Ember plays the more rebellious individual while Wade is the more averse, introverted individual. The magic of Elemental lays in the fictitious world it has created for itself. The canvas painted by the animators is nothing short of some of Pixar's best work, steeped in rich visuals, textures, and blithesome neighborhoods. There is lots of curiosity-peaking interest in this universe worth exploring, unfortunately the film and story just never decides to fully take its viewers there...",22
11,12,3.0,5.0,selmataco,2023-06-18,"I don't think anyone in the review mentioned this, but as an Asian, I see this as clearly an immigrant family trying to blend in with a big city and struggle with their own heritage and identity.The way that the differences between elements are mostly revealed in conflicts or flash backs full of agressive, discriminated dialogues ""go back to your fireland"" that in many levels sound very unpleasantly familiar (u know exactly what I mean).The problems are not resolved, and most disappointingly, the character's development is cliche rom-com jinxes with each other and giggles that just does nothing to the story other than making me cringe. What gets me more concerned is the portrait of the fire people's conservativeness and constrains applied to their offerings. What's the point of rephrasing a real-life issue, not elevating or solving them but just apply a cartoon filter to it?The style and the city reminds me of Zootopia, which did a much better job in connecting the characters on a deeper level through mysterious events. Unlike Zootopia, their is no underlying message or lesson learned, or mystery solved, or any reflection that resonate with the audience.Not recommended. Never missed any Pixar film, and this one is the most disappointing one I've ever seen.",13
12,13,4.0,8.0,Ibrahimrealibrahim,2023-06-15,Elemental is Pixar's latest film starring Leah Lewis as Ember and Mamoudou Athie as Wade. I walked into the movie with low expectations and complete disappointment and walked out actually crying. Elemental delivers an impressive conclusion and I'm glad they took a different turn and switch stuff around with this one. Not to spoil anything but this movie is creative like really creative and fun to watch I was really impressed. The chemistry between Ember and Wade felt rushed but I can't believe it actually worked at the end. I laughed I cried I enjoyed this movie and this is what matters. Down for a rewatch.,28

14,15,5.0,9.0,xeffy,2023-06-09,"""Elemental"" takes you on an incredible journey through a bustling city where people of different elemental backgrounds live side by side. Ember and Wade truly embody the film's central message: that we're more alike than we realize. As Ember, a fiery young woman, and Wade, a laid-back guy, discover their shared humanity, the movie beautifully explores themes of unity, understanding, and the incredible power of connection.The world-building in ""Elemental"" is absolutely stunning. The city itself is a visual feast, with each element having its own distinct architecture and style. From skyscrapers covered in lush greenery to water slides and wind-powered homes, every detail immerses you in this vibrant and enchanting world.The film's portrayal of how the elements interact is both amusing and touching. Whether it's a water-being's sneeze causing grass to sprout or Ember's intense heat affecting others around her, these moments showcase the intricate relationships between the elemental residents. They provide a delightful blend of entertainment and insight into the film's underlying plot.While the hint of romance between Ember and Wade adds an extra layer of intrigue, ""Elemental"" is so much more than just a love story. It delves deep into Ember's personal journey as she navigates the city and tries to form meaningful connections. The character development is strong, and you can't help but cheer for Ember and Wade as they face their challenges and strive to make a positive impact on their community.With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storyline, and heartfelt message, ""Elemental"" is a true cinematic gem. This film will captivate you, make you reflect, and leave you inspired. It's a must-watch. Prepare yourself for a captivating story that reminds us of the incredible strength found in unity and the beauty of finding common ground in a diverse world.",47

This is a RomeoJuliet kinda movie which would be fine but a PG movie for kids?? Come on...Adults it's adorable. Kids? For really?I'd rate this a 1010 if it wasn't a kids movie.PixarDisney needs to go back to just making silly kids movies. Why should I have to go prescreen a movie before my Godkids.. just crazy.The concept and many things are cute, why was the kissing scene too long, it was so magnified and long. Practically making out. I don't get it.",29
16,17,4.0,7.0,TomTalksFilms,2023-06-20,"Today I checked out odeons screen unseen for the first time and it turned out to be Elemental due for release over here in the UK two weeks on Friday.I had completely forgotten that Pixar often shows shorts before their new cinema releases and this time I was pleasantly surprised as it was Carls first date. The short film is a must see follow up to the film UP! As we follow Carl who with the help from his dog Dug gets ready for his first date since the passing of his wife Ellie. I won't say much more other than Elemental is worth watching just to see this short on the big screen alone.In a world where people seem to be getting further and further apart wether that's because of race, culture, sexuality etc Elemental tries to teach us that we should embrace our differences in order to not just learn but also to improve the world around us and ourselves.This film is the 27th Pixar feature film and is essentially a coming of age story that follows fire Element Ember as she moves with her family from fire city to Element City. Her family set up a shop and from a young age she has been working towards taking over the shop when she is old enough, that is until she meets Wade (who's a water element) when one of the pipes in the shop bursts. What follows is a Romantic adventure about growing up and taking steps into the adult world even if it means stepping outside of your comfort soon. The films plot is really a pretty generic coming of age story that we've seen time and time again however it's executed with that vibrant, colourful and funny Pixar flare and I just thought the film was beautiful and heart warming in a time where there's so much hatred around. I've seen that this film is getting a lot of hate and I don't understand why, for me it's one of the better recent Pixar films and one that I think will stick with me for a while. If I had any criticisms about this film then it would probably be that it builds up a big world when actually the story is quite small and a lot of the world doesn't really get explored but perhaps they can expand into the world more if the film gets sequels which I have to say I hope it does.Finally, I just want to add that there's a broken dam in this film and I don't know if I'm right in saying this but I do wonder if wether the dam is broken or fixed is a metaphor for where the two main characters relationship is at in any given point of the film? 🤔",4
17,18,1.0,1.0,Chase-Smith,2023-06-08,"Elemental is a very cliche plot of two worlds that love each other but family doesn't. Something we have seen since the 1400's. There is really no reason to go see this film as it has lame characters, bland dialogue, unfunny jokes. And it's just really boring. And just like lightyear, this movie hold nothing to make you care or remember the film. Honestly there really isn't much to say about this film, other than it's proven to see how far pixar has fallen over the years. And it's sad when not 1, not 2, but 3 of there past films have been critical failures. If this isn't a slap in the face and a huge punch to the gut. To get your stuff together and turn this train wreck around.",13
18,19,5.0,10.0,GusherPop,2023-06-15,"Pixar's recent movies have struggled to capture audiences, with previous non-sequels like ""Soul,"" ""Luca,"" and ""Turning Red"" resembling yesteryear, but launching directly to Disney+. The last real hit was 2019's ""Toy Story 4."" Fans will appreciate the ""Carl's Date"" short, ""Elemental,"" which combines fire and water, creating a successful film, and is Pixar's and Disney's best film since zootopia. ""Elemental"" is a rom-com with nonstop puns and on-the-nose aspects, but it still has a winning sweetness. The film's chemistry between Ember and Wade is corny, but it still works well, despite the corny moments. The film's rom-com elements, such as hot air balloon rides and authentic fire food, add to its overall appeal. ""Elemental"" has the wondrous aesthetic imagination of modern Pixar classics like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E."" However, composer Thomas Newman's score offers a more comprehensive vision of cross-cultural exchange than the film's muddled depiction of immigrant communities. While combustible from the moment, it makes a from memory after leaving the theater. Lewis portrays Ember with a playful warmth, complementing Athie's bubbling affability in Wade. The element element in ""Elemental"" is overly complicated and confusing, focusing on nothing children know about the natural world. The film's brisk pace and extensive exposition make it difficult to fit essential backstory into the final reel. Sohn should have made the plot simpler and focused on sincerity, as Pixar's sincerity is essential. The over-complicated premise creates confusing rules for children to learn, which do apply outside the film. The animation of Ember's body and Wade's fluid, transparent body is exciting, emphasizing malleability and abstraction. However, the film's promise of color, form, and movement is hemmed in by unimaginative storytelling. Only standout sequences, such as an underwater garden and hand-drawn animation, separate ""Elemental"" from other Pixar films. The characters are phosphorescent blobs traveling through realistically animated cityscapes, and the film never goes anywhere unexpected. The film follows Ember and Wade, two opposites who initially form a close bond but eventually separate due to a misunderstanding. However, their relationship becomes the film's center, a respite from the mixed metaphors and conceptual mechanics that often threaten the story's inner reality. The plot's frantic chain reaction keeps them together, providing a slight but endearing center. The film explores the mystery of what will happen if Ember and Wade touch a mysterious mystery in a city with ceramic and terracotta glass structures.",15
19,20,4.0,7.0,kevin_robbins,2023-06-16,"Elemental (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a city where multiple elements live, but the fire element is kept in their own area of town to keep them from harming others. They do their best to keep to themselves, and they prefer it that way, but sometimes the other world crashes into theirs. A family who moved to the city and started their own store is about to leave the store to their daughter, who is constantly trying to prove herself. As she is about to take over the shop she makes a mistake leading to her cellar being flooded with water. The young lady will need to work with water to save her store and prove she's ready to run the shop for her dad.This movie is directed by Peter Sohn (The Good Dinosaur) and contains the voices of Leah Lewis (The Half of It), Mamoudou Athie (Uncorked), Wendi McLendon-Covey (Bridesmaids), Ronnie Del Carmen (Inside Out) and Catherine O'Hara (Best in Show).The storyline for this was very entertaining and unique. The animation was outstanding and I loved the city. Disney did a great job capturing the imagination of the unique society, it kind of reminded me of Zootopia. The characters are easy to root for and tug at your heart strings, as wanting to make your parents happy is very relatable. There's also some great comedy mixed in here and there, especially the niece and nephew. The circumstances were a lot of fun and the ending was rewarding.Overall, this is a fun addition to the DisneyPixar universe that is worth a viewing. I would score this a 7-7.510 and strongly recommend it.",9
20,21,3.0,5.0,psychhelp,2023-06-18,"It's a story about a hothead and empath. Then a lot of racial content that is not intently pursued to make it look like casual, but the repetitive nature of it and stereotypes used says enough about it. However, I am giving a 5 star for the Pixar magic, how they were able to show fire and water is compatible, and for showing how Avatar: The Way of Water would look like if it was animated by Pixar through the visiting the Wisteria flower scene. At best, this is a spin-off of Inside Out (understand what your emotions are telling you and be who you are) presented in a different format. For an unknown reason, after thinking about the film, it makes me want to watch The Last Airbender movie once more, maybe just to compare mental notes.",8
21,22,4.0,7.0,JohnDeSando,2023-06-18,"Shakespeare needn't worry that Pixar's Elemental will replace Romeo and Juliet as the #1 love story of all time. However, this colorful animation has a right to be considered one of its kind in its thematic emphasis on opposites attracting and our seeking our own way rather than fulfilling someone else's dreams. Perhaps more of a dominant theme is the immigrant experience that shows the challenges of assimilation. Director Peter Sohn speaks of his Korean parents' experience as the inspiration.The linchpin of this typical Pixar piece is a world where the elements of earth, air, fire, and water peacefully co-exist if, for instance, the last two don't mix. When water denizen Wade Ripple (voice of Mamoudou Athie) falls for fire Ember (Leah Lewis), and she eventually succumbs, the incompatible worlds collide. The multiple metaphors and ingenious twists for each element, e.g., fire family business is called ""the Firehouse,"" are a tribute to the imagination of Sohn and his creative crew.The subtheme of parents' expectations is almost as strong as the love theme. Ember's dad expects her to take over his shop while she is reluctant to say she doesn't want to. Her budding romance almost busts because of this conflict. Elements does a credible job of showing how difficult it is for loving children not to fulfill the dreams of doting parents. What is not lost is the need for us to govern our own futures and not cave to the demands of others.Unlike other current movie dramas, especially animations like Spider-Man, Elements moves in a linear war with a plot that makes sense, even if it is predictable. Smaller children at my screening were restless, leading me to question if they should be 10 and beyond to appreciate the several themes; less than ten for a while will be distracted by the intricate city and explosive color.In the end it is still Pixar, a gifted Disney enterprise that never forgets it's all about the people.",3
22,23,4.0,8.0,MrDHWong,2023-06-16,"""Elemental"" is the 27th CGI animated feature film from Disney Pixar. Directed by Peter Sohn (""The Good Dinosaur"") and featuring the voices of Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie, it plays things relatively straight-forward in a nice little love story complimented by the usual fantastic visuals from the studio.In Elemental City, fire element immigrants Bernie (voiced by Robbie del Carmen) and Cinder Lumen (voiced by Shila Omni) run a convenience store where they face frequent discrimination from all the other local elements. The couple's young daughter Ember (voiced by Leah Lewis) dreams of one day running the store after her father retires, but has a difficult time controlling her temper. While dealing with multiple customers one morning, Ember quickly becomes overwhelmed and retreats into the basement to vent her frustrations, resulting in her accidentally breaking the water pipes. The ensuing flooding then causes the appearance of Wade Ripple (voiced by Mamoudou Athie), a water elemental health inspector who threatens to close the store down due to the insufficient plumbing. After some disagreements, both Ember and Wade start to realise that in spite of their contrasting elemental types, they may not be so different from each other as their society would have them believe.Pixar have had a long tradition of making films that personify things that wouldn't normally have a voice to begin with and turning it into something highly relatable. For instance, ""Toy Story"" made us believe that inanimate toys were capable of fearing the inevitability of being replaced while ""Inside Out"" helped us realise that our emotions and subsequent responses shape our outlook on life based on the lessons we learn from them. Because of this approach, Pixar films have been able to cross boundaries to appeal to virtually everybody, which is what I believe to be one of the key reasons why they still reign supreme today. In the studio's latest film ""Elemental"", we are shown a world where the elements are segregated by their opposing types told through the plot of a forbidden romance.From the perspective of the fire elemental Lumen family, we see that their kind are treated with notable hostility in comparison to every other elemental type. Due to fire's tendency to burn and destroy, whether intentional or not, the water, earth, and wind elements all live in fear of what they are capable of, and as a result, are reluctant to allow them to mingle with the rest of the city's population. This film's overarching theme of xenophobia and racial prejudice makes for an interesting look at how people in the real world may view immigrants from another country. Though I appreciate the filmmakers for tackling such a serious subject matter in a way that all ages can understand, something like this has already been done before in another non-Pixar animated film. The 2016 film ""Zootopia"" also dealt with themes of cultural differences in a more appealing way, whereas here it is used as a mere backdrop for setting up Ember and Wade's love affair. While I wouldn't necessarily call this is a bad thing, it doesn't really feel fresh or new.At this point, it seems redundant to once again praise Pixar for the quality of their animation but every time I watch their latest movie, I still end up being blown away. I loved how beautiful and colourful the Elemental City looked, a place where anthropomorphic elements live and work. The attention-to-detail on the atmosphere is superb, which really helps make the city look like it has been lived in for a long time. We are treated to some creatively built apartment blocks that house the water elements and an aerial basketball stadium where wind elements slam dunk a ball using air currents. All of the world building is handled very nicely, but what stood out to me was how it is shown that fire elements are not welcome in almost every building. Signs saying ""No Fire"" are placed outside large venues and water security guards patrol residential areas in hopes that the occupants can live safely. The juxtaposition of this great big city in a prejudice-based society reminded me of how it was during Apartheid era South Africa and pre-civil rights America. These parallels are a rather bleak addition to the film's plot, but it feels like it is only half addressed in favour of the romance between the two main characters. Then again, there is only so much you can divulge about bigotry in a family film before you alienate the younger demographic too much.I also really liked both of the lead characters, with Leah Lewis injecting the essential amount of energy into her performance as Ember. What I enjoyed about Ember was her vulnerability, in that while she is talented at what she does, it is her insecurities that are holding her back from greatness. After seeing both of her parents treated intolerably by the other elemental types, Ember believes she is doomed to the same fate as them, viewed as an object of ridicule by those who don't understand her culture. Her feelings of inadequacy manifest in the form of her explosive temperament, something that does nothing but exacerbate her family's inability to be accepted by others. Nonetheless, her fiery personality also includes a level of boldness to her character, in that she is not afraid to speak up for what she believes in.In stark contrast to Ember, we see the total opposite in Wade, who is easily reduced to tears over even the most minor of issues. Mamoudou Athie plays into Wade's vulnerability differently to Ember's, in that his emotional interactions with those around him are simply a product of what it is like to be a water element. It is established that Wade's other family members become sentimental at the drop of a hat as well, which is shown prominently when he plays a party game that involves making somebody cry within a set amount of time. Wade's patient, sympathetic view of those around him is a nice counter to Ember's anxious, feisty nature, making their relationship so much more believable. Though the eventual outcome is pretty predictable, I still enjoyed watching how close Ember and Wade grew throughout the film.For the longtime Pixar fan, ""Elemental"" may not rank among the studio's all time best but it still has plenty to enjoy regardless of how you approach it. You can appreciate it simply on the merits of its great animation or for its social commentary on cultural divide. Although it doesn't really say anything that hasn't been said before, it at least finds a way to say it in a manner that only Pixar films could, and that definitely counts for something. I can only imagine what Pixar will personify next, but I'm certain they'll find something worthwhile and make it work.I rate it 810.",11
23,24,4.0,7.0,IonicBreezeMachine,2023-06-20,"In a world where beings of fire, water, air, and earth exist, Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis) is a first generation fire elemental and daughter of immigrants Bernie and Cinder (Ronnie del Carmen and Shila Ommi respectively) who emigrated to Element City facing prejudice and systemic segregation to start a bodega, called The Fireplace, that is the unofficial hub of Firetown which Bernie hopes Ember will someday inherit. Ember routinely struggles to keep her temper with customers and during one such episode inadvertently damages an old water pipe which pulls in city inspector Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie) from the other side of town and must reluctantly issue several citations on the bodega. After learning of Ember's struggles with trying to takeover The Fireplace from her ailing father, Wade feeling guilty over it tries to help Ember save The Fireplace as well as find out why there is water still running through Firetown when it shouldn't and eventually a romance blooms in spite of the historic incompatibility with fire and water.Elemental is the latest film from Pixar and comes to us from director Peter Sohn who based the initial idea off his immigrant parents and based the underlying concept around the relationship between fire and water. The film was primarily based off of the structure of romantic comedies and dramas such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and The Big Sick while also building those ideas around the core elemental one. In terms of execution Elemental does have some of the same issues of Sohn's The Good Dinosaur, but it is a nice light romance with a solid presentation of its core themes.I'll start off by saying the opening scenes where we establish Element City and the characters of Bernie and Cinder are really good as we see them rejected by several prospective renters as despite Element City's history of welcoming immigrants as per the murals on the harbor, the fire elementals being the newest entrants to society are very much treated with hostility and prejudice. This sequence continues onward with the Lumen's eventually buying a neglected building an refurbishing it as their bodega and overtime it becoming the central point of Firetown. The animation used to bring the elementals and their world to life is nicely done as there's a lot of great details in the textures and movements of the characters with the distortions of water and the movement of fire and while on occasion the world building can seem a little spotty and doesn't feel as fully realized as Zootopia's, it does a good job of addressing systemic racism in communities. Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie are both really solid as Ember and Wade and their interactions with each other are complemented with some cute moments and amusing exchanges. I also rather liked the relationship with Ember and her father Bernie played by Ronnie del Carmen that while sweet does a good job of setting up the wedge issue.While I think Elemental has good pieces in place, I did feel like some parts of the film felt underdeveloped especially in regards to a leak in Firetown responsible for the water seeping in that doesn't feel all that interesting and I felt like from a world building perspective it opened up some questions that the movie didn't really address. While Elemental has no villain in it, this is the kind of plot point that feels like it could've used a villain be it an unscrupulous developer or a construction firm rigging bids to add that little extra ""something"" that's missing from this plot point because it's a pretty big one and its not all that fleshed out.I liked Elemental for the things that did genuinely work even if it stands in the shadows of others who've covered similar material. I think this is a much better project from Peter Sohn in comparison to The Good Dinosaur even if like that film there are still some flubs in the presentation of the central idea even if not to the extent The Good Dinosaur had them. But contrary to what people have said, this is not one of Pixar's worst movies especially when you consider the Cars trilogy and Lightyear exist.",4

The story is well structured and the characters are well developed. The music is cute, the animations are high quality, of course the CGI is also high quality, the character design is cute.The film is pleasant to see, I recommend seeing it with the whole family, it's not a heavy film and it flows well. It also has some basic subjects dealt with intelligently, without going overboard. It's not the movie of the year, but it's definitely a cute movie that kids will enjoy, for sure. Very cute, take the kids to see it.",32
25,26,5.0,10.0,PrNycTina1091,2023-06-11,"I caught a screening of this film at the Tribeca Film Festival and it was so stunning and beautiful - the visuals and the story. It's an adorable, heartfelt family film about the immigrant experience told in a way kids can understand, an animated romantic comedy anyone can enjoy.It's a unique take on a love story as old as time - 2 people from 2 very different worlds meet and suddenly everything changes. They start to see the world from a new perspective, learn about and fall in love with a culture they had never known before. Wade and Ember represent so many people who live in diverse places and are immersed in different cultures.I'm from a mixed family and I grew up in NYC so this film touched my heart in ways I can't adequately articulate. I don't think I've ever seen this kind of story told in a way children can understand - sometimes when 2 people who live in a place where people come from all over the world, you meet someone you never would have met before and you fall in love.I hope people take the time to watch this movie and I can't wait to see what Peter Sohn works on next.",46

Each character was very well fleshed out, even the side characters like the cloud's romance and Wades little sister. The artwork was leaps ahead of other studios, making element city a place you actually feel you could live. The story of a young person finding themself outside of the family business has been done before, but not in such an imaginative way, and not with these unique characters. I honestly can't remember an animated movie making me feel this way since Inside Out. Please, support this movie! Go see it in theaters, I certainly will be again.",2
27,28,4.0,8.0,rannynm,2023-06-15,"Elemental is a beautiful animated film that fills the screen with color and excitement and is a great viewing experience for audiences of all ages. The animation is definitely the highlight of the film; the plot leaves a little to be desired.Elemental tells the story of Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis), a fire element who lives in the Element City, where water, land, fire and air residents live together. Ember lives in the fire neighborhood and hopes to take over her dad's fire shop, but her anger issues and inability to control her temper is standing in her way. One day, Ember meets Wade (Mamoudou Athie), a water element who tries to shut down her dad's business. After convincing Wade by explaining what the business means to her family, Wade tries to help her; only it's too late since the paperwork has already been sent to his boss. Wade and Ember must work together to save her dad's business, and along the way, they discover more than they ever knew was possible.Elemental is a beautiful film to watch. The animated creation of Elemental is incredible; every scene is filled with vibrant colors. I love all the elements that they incorporate into the city's design, especially with the multi-cultural neighborhoods like those that you would find in an actual city. The character animation is also great, especially with Ember; it is fascinating to see her flames become brighter and change shape depending on the weather. My favorite scene of the movie is the one underwater, as those visuals are the best in the film. However, the plot leaves a little to be desired. There are a lot of conflicts that are fixed quickly, so none of them feel that significant. Although I love Wade and Ember together, it is a little confusing since it is shown multiple times that water and fire shouldn't touch, so it feels counterintuitive to what is being stated in the film. Gale Cumulus (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is very funny and I loved watching her and wanted more. Also, Clod (Mason Wertheimer) is absolutely adorable; it was nice watching other elements to see how they operate, not just fire and water. My favorite relationship in the film is between Ember and her father (Ronnie del Carmen) -- it was heartwarming to see the respect the two have for each other and the love they share.Elemental conveys the message of family, respect and loving others. It also has underlying messages of not discriminating against others, which is important in a world where some people are not always treated fairly.I give Elemental 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus adults. It releases in theaters on June 16, 2023. By Emma D., KIDS FIRST!",8

29,30,2.0,4.0,suzasailor,2023-06-20,"What can I say about Elemental that will do it justice? It never really takes off. It's a familiar tale with a new setting and two dimensional characters.Pros- visually this puppy is stunning, the world is inspiring but familiar. The sound design is well done.Cons- the voice acting is very all over the place, some ok performances, but many just don't fit. The pacing is not very good either. The characters are too one note or two note.Overall this is kind of a bland movie going experience. It's an immigration tale of foreigners making it in a new city and dealing with the prejudices of being different, very Zootopia, but unlike that very charming tale, this movie just drags and the characters are very bland. The fire dad might be the most intriguing character but by far the biggest offender is Wade Ripple, the water boy, the just shove him on you and try very hard to make you like him and the chemistry between Ember and him is so contrived. Also there is no really good side characters for them to play off of. Kind of a waste in my opinion.It's a film that's pretty forgettable in the end. 410.",3
30,31,4.0,7.0,Hey_Harry,2023-06-15,"Pixar has been on a rough streak in recent years with only a few really good movies in-between. I personally feel that Pixar's golden years ended somewhere after their 2009 film, Up. On that note, I'm glad to report that fans of Pixar's Up have something to look forward to with Pixar's latest short that plays before ""Elemental.""On the surface, ""Elemental is very similar to ""Zootopia"" with its unique world-building and social commentary on immigration and multiculturalism. The character designs and animation look pretty good although the character designs lack the wow factor of earlier Pixar films such as ""Inside Out."" ""Elemental"" mainly focuses on the relationship between the fire girl Ember and the water boy Wade which becomes an allegory of intercultural conflict throughout the movie. It's a fairly creative idea though the allegory itself is sometimes a bit too on the nose. Overall, Elemental delivers a fairly good message about intercultural relationships although I still maintain that Zootopia handled the same concept and much better.As for the love story in the center of the film, I think the romance between Ember and Wade was handled really well throughout the film and as with other Pixar movies, there are some emotional tearjerker moments in-between. However, and I've been saying this a lot lately about films from Disney and Marvel, but they could stand to ease up on the jokes and allow the atmosphere and tension to sink in instead of punctuating every serious moment with a joke. Nevertheless, Elemental is still a decent enough flick. Nothing too great but still an enjoyable flick with scenes of heartwarming romance.",11
31,32,4.0,8.0,masonsaul,2023-06-20,"Elemental may not be Pixar at their strongest or deepest but it remains a delight to watch thanks to its gorgeous animation, emotional maturity and a genuinely affecting love story at the centre of it all. The immigration metaphor isn't particularly nuanced but it's still really effective and handled with care and sensitivity.Opposites attract in the form of Leah Lewis' overly angry Ember and Mamoudou Athie's overly sensitive Wade but as the film progresses they become so much more layered and the romance that begins to blossom is absolutely strongest part because it feels so palpable.Peter Sohn's direction is great, the is clearly a very personal story and it's just so good that he's able to tell this story at this scale. The animation is flawless, every penny of that $200 million dollar budget is definitely seen on screen and every aspect of Element City is a real visual marvel.The music by Thomas Newman is amazing, it's definitely not what you'd expect but it works perfectly and makes the film feel so much more emotional, vibrant and awe inspiring. It fits so well with the central romance and the core themes as well.",3
32,33,4.0,8.0,G-Joshua-Benjamin,2023-06-16,"I have not liked many Pixar movies lately. I just feel they lack feelings and emotions. When this movie ended, I knew that this one had both.First, it looks amazing. The background stuff and all those little things you don't even realize you are seeing they all just flow together.The voice work was great. I first thought the main guy was being done by Zachery L. But after I looked, I was happy to see someone I had never heard of. It's always cool to see someone different.The stuff they did with the elements. Like making steam to raise the lady off the ground, I thought was so cool.Really, it's about knowing a way of life. You have people in your family, your friends, your role models and so on. They live a certain way. Others follow along and so beings a track. There may be nothing wrong with it. But one day a person on that track may start to feel differently. While they love the way they live and their life, they just feel that there is more out there for them. They need to decide if they will just keep living the same way they have been. The way those they admire have and just exist as others have or do they take the chance and try something different. While they may have no way of knowing rather it will work out or not, if they never even try, what might they lose.Great movie. I look forward to getting the 4K when it is released.

As with all Pixar films the animation is simply incredible and they always seem to take it that extra step with each film they do. The level of detail always blows my mind and honestly have no idea how they achieve some of the details.The story was typical Pixar but it worked well with the world that was created. Voice acting was good and there were some funny moments.However whilst this is a good Pixar film, I feel the bar has been set so high that no original idea they currently come up with is going to beat their best.None of the characters are memorable and there's no memorable scenes which is a shame but I still enjoyed it.",3
34,35,4.0,8.0,04GreatFlick,2023-06-17,"Wow! By far my favorite Pixar movie since Soul. This movie was on my radar, but I didn't get to see any promos other than the teaser. June is such a packed month for movies that I was planning on spreading out all the movies throughout the month and this was one of the ones I had penciled in for later in June. My Plans changed towards this weekend's views, and I subbed it in, and man am I glad I did especially because I was able to watch it in the premium Dolby format.This is definitely a movie that is going to hit harder for the older age groups. It starts with the Carls Date new Short. If you have seen Up and Dugs Days on Disney+ then you will love this. There is a specific part towards the end of the Short that really hits hard. I am assuming there wasn't a dry eye in the theater that early on.Then you get Elemental, a beautiful love story showcasing the magic of opposites attracting. Silly at times to keep things light but damn it really kicks you in the gut once the final frame hit. It really does take you on a journey. Moves a bit fast in certain spots but it does stick the landing at the end. People around me were in tears including my girlfriend who had a blast watching this. Incredible outing by Pixar.

It's really well put together and while it's no WALL-E it's still a great movie. It's very focused on family dynamics and has Disney style love and magic. There's several likeable characters and almost nothing to cringe over. The only real negatives I could think of is the standard subpar logic of animated films and a couple of scenes felt redundant like the just repurposed the same ideas we've all seen 100 times. But the appreciation it showed to large cities and the many different cultures that make them up and the story they told about these characters struggles were inspiring and the movie is something I'll watch again when it comes out for streaming.",2
36,37,5.0,9.0,kjproulx,2023-06-21,"It feels good to be able to watch Pixar films in theatres again. I've felt bad over the last few years for the studio dumping them straight on Disney+. The animators and filmmakers made their films with the mindset that they would play in theatres. Last year I loved seeing Lightyear on the big screen and now, Elemental has hit theatres and I think all families should watch this one. Here are the reasons I loved watching this film and why I believe others may as well.Ember and her fire family move to Element City, where all elements live in proximity to each other. Water doesn't mix with fire, fire puts out plants, and so on. The underlying idea that elements don't mix is all about how living with other races shouldn't be an issue, to begin with. At the core of this film though is an immigration story of a girl and her parents who move from their hometown for a fresh start and build a shop. One day, her father wishes for his daughter to take it over, but after falling for a water man in Wade Ripple, she may not want that same dream for herself. This film becomes a forbidden romance story and I honestly can't think of a more creative way to teach kids these lessons.From beginning to end, this film is filled with gorgeous animation (and that's probably the hundredth time I've reviewed a Disney or Pixar film using those words) and the emotional core never missed a beat. I was thinking it was a fairly well-done story until the emotional payoffs which ultimately took me over the edge and had me loving it as a whole. The fun montages, underlying (and great) political messages, fantastic characters, and the terrific family story, were all ""elements"" that had me falling for this film. Sure, there are cliches sprinkled throughout, but I'm getting to the point where cliches in films don't bother me anymore if they're well done.Sometimes a good family film with a heart of gold is what everyone needs and I couldn't get enough of this one while watching it. I don't consider it one of Pixar's best films, but it's one of the best in a few years. It seems that not many people are flocking out to this one, which is a shame because it's more than just a visual treat. If you're in he mood for a great emotional story or jus want to take the family to something everyone can enjoy, I recommend it be Elemental. I had a great time with this one.",3
37,38,4.0,8.0,Entertainmentsparadise,2023-06-18,"Elemental, sheds light on complex societal issues of discrimination and prejudice.Personally, I adored it. Rather than using race, gender, class, or sexual orientation, this film employs elements as an analogy to convey its powerful message. With phrases like 'elements don't mix,' 'marry fire,' 'you don't belong,' and 'go back to Fireville,' the movie speaks volumes about the treatment of individuals, particularly in America.Drawing from my sociological and educational background, as well as personal experiences of discrimination and racism, this film hit close to home. It beautifully portrays the struggles faced by parents who cling to tradition, preferring their children to stay within their 'element' and culture, rather than taking risks and learning from others. Element delves deep into these profound themes, cleverly hidden within an easygoing film.The story revolves around Ember, an elemental fire woman, whose family migrates to a metropolis brimming with diverse elements. The prevalent notion is that elements should remain separate, as fire is hot and destructive. However, Ember dreams of continuing her father's legacy, and despite occasional bursts of anger, she develops an unexpected relationship with Wade, a forbidden water man.The love story unfolds in an endearing manner, relatable to anyone who has experienced a relationship with someone from a different culture or upbringing. It masterfully captures Ember's emotional journey as she visits Wade's water family, who ask awkward questions and make statements about never encountering a fire element before. The dialogue resonates deeply with first-generation individuals from various backgrounds, who come from humble beginnings and date those from more affluent families. The cleverly crafted dialogue makes you pause and think, 'Did they really just say that?' The love story culminates in emotional progressions and a heartwarming portrayal of how families navigate the concept of marriage.While the movie provides moments of laughter and witty wordplay, I yearned for more exploration of the other elements and their personalities.Ultimately, Element is a resounding success, teaching us about discrimination, cultural norms, and love, while evoking a wide range of emotions. It delves beneath the surface, leaving an unexpected and deeply satisfying impression. I wholeheartedly recommend watching this movie; you won't regret it, especially if you're a Pixar fan.""",4

I'm a big fan of 3D when it's done right, and trust me when I say ... they got this one right. It was like a 3D symphony. During one part, a mother sitting to my right was so enraptured that she was sitting forward on the edge of her seat in awe. Yes folks, it's that beautiful.The story was simple and sweet, but definitely with enough jazz to stay interesting. The different type of animation that they came up with lent greatly to the 3D experience, but it was the Pixar magic that kept it at its finest. Soft shimmers of prism exuding in a 360 degree effect that makes your jaw drop. When Ember flared she seemed to fill the room. There's a part in the middle that breaks down into an ethno-techno wizardry that has to be seen in 3D to be believed. It was so beautiful it almost brought me to tears. And I did cry, to the story, at the end. Pixar strikes again.I saw an ad saying this was the 3D movie of the summer. 200% agree.

The animation is admittedly superb, and there are a few good jokes (thought-bubble probably being the best) but the plot (another lame re-hash of Romeo and Juliet) is painfully predictable; and it's hard to warm to any of the characters (that wasn't a pun, even if some of the character are made out of fire).For the first time in ages, the main film is accompanied by a short - featuring Carl and Doug from Up.

Now they've picked the elements.Elemental has more in-depth story about Immigrants I was not expecting in a DisneyPixar movie. It was not hidden at all.

If you are a fan of Animated Movies then you'll likely enjoy this one.For me, I had a lot of fun. It was really fun, the characters were not only funny but relatable. It's pretty easy for me to get annoyed with characters in anything really. So they have to have reasons for their actions, why they are acting the way they are, which this movie does well. Elemental gives the characters realistic reasons as to why they act the way they do. At least for Ember.Ember feels like a character I would hate if she wasn't written well, but they did amazing with her story. And the same thing with Wade. Though he is a cry baby, he is a character willing to stand up for what he believes in without fear.

49,50,4.0,7.0,bastille-852-731547,2023-06-17,"There's no question that Pixar has produced some of the highest-quality animated movies of all time, from classics such as ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Up."" While this film certainly isn't at the upper tier of quality that Pixar films can achieve, it's a solid animated film overall that blends creativity and a heartfelt sense of earnestness. It won't stick with you forever, but it's still far better than most animated films released today. It should generally work well for families with younger kids, and should also scratch the itch of nostalgia at least somewhat for teens and adults who grew up with and loved Pixar's earlier films.This film is set in Element City, a fictional metropolis with anthropomorphic fire, water, air, and land people. It centers around Ember, a young fire woman, and Wade, a young water man, who both share a deep affection for each other despite societal values discouraging mixing and further interaction between those of other ""elements."" As can be expected from a Pixar film, the animation is beautiful on both a conceptual and an artistic level. Element City is beautifully laid out and analyzed, and a clever amount of thought is put into the metaphysical properties of the world and the different ""element people."" For example, scenes of water people ""crying"" are used as a hilarious and cunning punchline. The world-building complements the story as it provides greater context for why characters came to Element City and what their day-to-day lives are like within their respective section of the city; these routine intricacies are wrapped up within the film's greater plot and its allegorical messages concerning immigration and the dangers of xenophobia. These messages can sometimes come across as a bit heavy-handed, but still contribute to a story with just enough emotion and heart to get the job done. Despite the clever concept, ""Elemental"" could have used a more significant and substantial plot with greater narrative cohesion, as the film seems a bit lacking in story (and what story there is fairly generic.) This would have helped elevate it to a higher-quality tier of Pixar films. The plot concerns are at least somewhat offset by the engaging characterization and use of setting, tone, and.a beautiful animation styleaesthetic, but they do mean that this film cannot achieve the outstanding level of quality merited by Pixar's better films. That said, this is still a good and entertaining film that I generally recommend. 710Note: I saw the film in 3D.

It's a pretty well-balanced movie with an unlikely story of connection between fire and water.The story follows the main character, Ember, who is a first generation daughter of immigrants who struggled to make a name for themselves but succeeded in the imaginary city where all of the elements live in harmony with each other for the most part. The father wants to pass on the fire shop to Ember and she seemingly wants to follow in her father's footsteps. However, she encounters a problem where the shop is about to be closed down due to 30+ violations in regulations.She has to set out on a mission to save her father's shop, discover herself, and discover true love despite their elemental differences.The writers and director of this movie did a great job of making the world seem realistic. It's reflective of immigrant families moving to different parts of the world and trying to set up a new life for their future generations. As we get to know Ember and her family, we can see the struggles that she goes through as a first generation of an immigrant family. Does she please her father by being a good daughter, or does she do what she wants to do despite the fact that it is not exactly what her father intended?",6
51,52,5.0,10.0,JakeLizarraga,2023-06-17,"Elemental is not the first Pixar movie I've watched, nor is it the first that's made me cry. The animation studio is known for producing tearjerkers like Up and Toy Story.However, I found Elemental to be much more relatable.I don't know what it's like to be a widower or an abandoned toy, but I do know what it feels like to love someone so much yet not know if you'll get to keep them.To feel so lucky that they're in front of you but terrified that you'll lose them because they give into their family's wishes instead of choosing what will make them happiest.At a base level, this film hit differently than any other Pixar movie primarily because of how relatable it was (at least for me).It was so similar to the origin story that my fiancée and I found ourselves in during the early years of our relationship.Hurting each other's feelings - because we were ourselves hurting - yet refusing to give up on each other because of the distinct sense that we had something worth fighting for.In summary, Pixar has once again managed to juxtapose hilarious scenes for kids to enjoy with a deep and relatable narrative for adults to ponder.",8
52,53,4.0,8.0,Mishutka22,2023-06-19,"Elemental is a wonderful story with mesmerizing animation and art. I wondered how 3d animation could be improved or how it could impress me more. And ""Elemental"" did it. A charming love story in the world of ""Elements"". Pixar did a wonderful job to find the source of narration throughout elements. Actually, we don't get the answer why elements cannot mix and what's the ""chemistry"" after they are mixed. I mean that there is a problem of relation of the audience themselves to elements. We understand Embers beliefs, moral choice and desire, I can recognize and relate myself with her, but I cannot compare myself as an element in ""Elemental world"".And somehow I can judge animation by how my daughter is engaged watching them. ""Luca"" - 40 minutes. ""Wall-E"", ""Ratatouille"", ""Toy Story 1,2,3,4"", ""Cars"", ""Incredibles"" - several times in a row, ""Turning Red"" - 25 minutes, ""Encanto"" - has fallen asleep, ""Lightyear"" - 10 minutes, ""Elemental"" - 30 minutes.My humble opinion from a guy who is not an expert how he would improve this story because for 60 minutes I didn't actually sympathize or empathize much to characters. Even if I recognized myself in Ember. Why? Let me try to figure out. This is the second ""love story"" from Pixar. ""Wall-E"" was a science-fiction (science-feature) movie with a love story permeated by mythology: Odyssey (returning home) and Adam and Eve (Wall-E and Eve, whose love returned life and humanity on Earth). This synergy and transcendence of genres helped ""Wall-E"" to become a world cultural heritage (like the quoted there Van Gogh). I was expecting in the second act that this love story would be filled with a detective line about a hole somewhere in the waterfront. But actually it didn't happen. I don't want to say that creators must satisfy my expectations, but there was no alternative. I think that all storyline of becoming Ember different and accepted by her father could be much more strong and dramatic if this love story and fantasy would be transcended by detective line. Because the detective line could solve other unsolved problems with justifying, explaining and engaging ""The Element city"". Because what the point in ""The Element city""? Why is it so attractive? Why this hole appeared and no-one really fixed it? I think that the Pixar's best detective line was in ""Monsters inc."". I won't explain how there the detective line justified Monstropolis and made it natural. Because the story of returning Boo (exploration of the truth) united all storylines, all characters arcs, all events and changings and put much (huge) pressure on the protagonists and the audience. And helped to create and reveal big philosophy through the layers of thoughts. I know, that comparing the movies from post Lasseter-Catmull-Jobs era with Lasseter-Catmull-Jobs era is annoying, but I tried to show an example of narration. Because there I really didn't get ""The Element city"". It is not conveyed. It's just beautiful and... beautiful. So that's my view on why ""Elemental"" lacks of drama energy and strength for storylines.Thank you once again for such astonishing art!",2
53,54,4.0,7.0,jackson_ro,2023-06-18,"Not Pixar at it's best, but a middling film that represents the brand well and keeps hope alive until the next one. Elemental tells of a story that has been told a million times but in a world full of elements (no pun intended) that is creative and fun. I feel like so much could be told outside of ember and Wade, perhaps the film will work better as a series for the future much like what they have done with Zootopia. But unlike the Zootopia film, elemental simply has a weaker story and a weaker cast of characters to make the film more memorable. The film focused too much on the notion that elements don't match but at times loses focus on the other less featured elements.",1
54,55,4.0,8.0,andrewchristianjr,2023-06-22,"A beautiful picture with a great parallel to immigration and a stunning coming of age story with self discovery and pursuit of personal ambitions. I genuinely think this is easily one of the most romantic movies from Pixar and fans of romantic comedies in general will be delighted. The movie is so undeniably sweet and heartfelt. All this boosted by the colorful and unique animation makes this a movie that is one of the better entries from the studio in the last few years. I don't think it is among the best of Pixar, but that is an enormous ask of a studio that has given us so many all-time classics.",0

Beside from the realistic things, this movie overall has beautiful animation and a fun plot. People will find some of the jokes funny, but this film focuses on a more serious tone. It will still be fun for kids, and will have some cute moments. Pixar and Disney have made another good film, and hopefully Wish and Elio will be pleasant too. This is worth a weekend trip, go take some friends for a film that you will (probably) mostly enjoy.",4

62,63,4.0,8.0,lauramguerard,2023-06-18,"Elemental is a beautiful display of art, and a heartwarming, tearjerker of a story. I love that it is clean, nonviolent, and imparts several positive messages. This is one of the few films I've seen from the 2000s that feels so positive overall. I left the cinema feeling revitalized and optimistic. Elemental hits a lot of familial tones and watching it together was a bonding experience for my son and me. It also elicited thoughts of my relationships with my parents and fond memories from childhood. The visuals are incredible and raise the bar, especially watching lovely flickering Ember come alive so fluidly.",4
63,64,3.0,6.0,iamianiman,2023-06-19,"Yes, our first thought when we saw this film was that this is a twin of Inside Out. We just got the vibe looking at the poster. And watching this film really reminded us with it. They were some similarities but we're not saying this is a rip-off, it's far from that. If Inside Out lives inside the brain of a person, the characters here actually live in their own-built world, civilized and cultured just like we live on planet Earth.It puts a smile on our face knowing that we still have some originalities left in the creative team department. As far as we're concerned, Elemental is much likely an original made film, with a brilliant concept that helps viewers to understand what it means to coexist with others who have different ideologies, interests, skin colours, races, and ethnicities.It follows Ember, a fiery young woman who lives in a city where fire, water, land and air residents live together. After an incident, she meets a go-with-the-flow guy and together, they embark on a journey of life, friendship and possibly, love. Reading the synopsis, you would think it's a run-of-the-mill movie. Well, the plot is nothing special, you may even compare it to Romeo & Juliet but the concept itself is what made the movie different from the archive. An animated movie with four different living elements? Count us in!Aside from the original concept, we like that there's something for all of us. Something that each of us can get from the movie; both children and adults. It's more relevant now than ever. As a viewer, you get a lot from this; you'll learn how to coexist with others and of different races, navigate interracial relationships, immigration, and cultural appreciation amongst others. For children, they will learn how an element reacts to another element in the context of chemistry.Bringing the subject of chemistry, they are a lot of chemical processes, formulas and reactions that are brought in very creative ways. They constantly show us how chemistry works visually and verbally like how fire and water reacts and if oxygen is important for Ember to live. This will be so much fun for viewers. Even if you hate chemistry (like we do), we promise you that you will enjoy all the 'fun facts' bits here.Not only that, the characters associated with their elements fit nicely into who they are supposed to be. An example, Wade is a soft-hearted guy who loves to cry because he is naturally water which sums up the logic that goes with water. His whole family also loves to shed tears. Ember easily gets angry because she is fire. It's entertaining when you get to see they think, feel and do based on who they are.But here's the thing, because the main characters here are Ember (fire) and Wade (water), they kinda ignore earth and air. We felt like they didn't have much screen time and they're just extras here. Should they be more scenes with them, this movie could have been better. They spent so much time on fire and water that they forgot the existence of the other two. Supposedly, they could have them be neighbours or friends, showing what it would be like if 4 of them interact with one another. It would have been so much fun.It also didn't take its time to craft its world-building, the details of the surroundings and how all these elements come to be civilized. Of course they did at times but there was just something that left us unfulfilled. Somehow, we felt like we saw only a part of the world, like it was not explored down to the ground. There wasn't really exposition of the history of the world and how it came to be.But Elemental has an overall good storyline and comedy as it follows the story of Ember and Wade and the journey that they go through together. Yes, the scope could have been better and the script could have been polished but the film itself is quite engaging as their personalities are what kept the story alive. Oh and also, we could see that they use two types of animation here. While everything is clearly 3D animated, the fire community including Ember has a 2D-like animation style that is just gorgeous to look at.Verdict: While it is far from the standards of the best Pixar movies, Elemental champions itself with a well-made concept, an interesting cast of characters beautifully hybrid animation and 101 lessons catered for both adults and children. World-building and the almost-forgotten existence of Earth and Air communities may be the problems, but what really saves this movie is its intelligence in bringing the concept to life; showing the unique elements you wouldn't usually get from other worlds.",0

It really hits home about family relationships as well as giving new people a shot, even if first impressions aren't great.The social commentary the movie makes is poignant without being a particular word that will get your review blocked on here because this company is the same word; you feel the meaning without it being shoved at you and pulling you out of the story. And the story that is shown is fresh, something Pixar could teach the rest of Disney's film departments a thing or two about.The sly humor, visual beauty, and heartfelt story make this the movie of the summer, if not the year!",2

I don't care, the truth is I always be supportive for the works of Pixar. Love story of water and fire element touched my soul. I even cried at one point. Good humour and soundtracks, I really enjoyed it. Pixar isn't afraid to include life and death in his stories. Everything is just the opposite, they perfectly combine them. They always have fresh plots. So what, that this is possibly a cliché. But it's still very different from other clichéd stories. And because of this, Pixar stories are loved by a hundred people in the world. So, TISHOK<3.",6

I expected it to be longer because it was a film we had been waiting for a long time. However, I think they want to create a new story for the second film.The animation quality in the film was quite high with the use of new technologies. It was a great opportunity to showcase the talents of the voice actors because you needed to feel many of their emotions.It seems like a mix of Up, Toy Story, and Finding Nemo. The details they share with us during the transitions between stories make you feel like you're part of the film.

Through the struggles faced by the characters in the film, we see the challenges of blending different cultural traditions and customs, and the importance of preserving cultural identity. The theme of overcoming odds and generational trauma is deeply intertwined with the immigrant experience portrayed in the film. It offers a poignant reminder of the resilience and determination of immigrants and their families, inspiring us to embrace diversity and follow our own path towards success.",5

Elementals lacks that grand pulling effect some of the earlier movies always had.That aside, Elementals what it lacks in ""pixar power"" makes up for creativity. There were several instances across the movie where I was impressed with how creative the elementals did things. Its more of like ""Hey that is really cool, I didn't know you could do this with fire and that with water."" You could also see they incorporated a good number of scientific rules with the elements, that's something I greatly appreciate.Now for the story, well, it was all right. It's just the usual love story featuring two people from different backgrounds. I will give bonus points for the very fluid animation. The designs may not be appealing to me, yet the movement of the elemental characters spoke for itself.But yeah, Elementlals is all right, not a must watch, but a good dive into a different Pixar World.",0

PHONOMANAL. ELEMENTAL on the other hand. It's a story about love, fatherhood, immigration, and so much more. It's beautifully written for a love story and honestly keeps you on your toes a bit with the wonderfully amazing world of Element City. You can watch it with at least nothing in mind about what this Pixar Film is also. Again, beautifully choreographed script and story, Especially how it's laid out. Saw it in 3D and the artwork just POPS out right outta the screen. Take your kids, your wife, your crew, ya boys 😂. It's a journey anyone would get a kick out of.

It was pretty decent.The movie follows Ember Lumen planning to follow her family's footsteps, but in the processes meets Wade Ripple, a go-with-the-flow guy. Along they way they realize how much they have in common.Once again, average story, but nothing too bad. The characters are fine, the plot is fine, the visuals and score are amazing, but that's typically a Pixar given.I do think it's a really cool idea for the director to tell his own story through these elements, and I can definitely see the passion behind this film. It's decent, and I think it's worth watching at least once.",0
74,75,4.0,8.0,onjgrills,2023-06-20,"I went to watch Elemental expecting to see a beautifully animated movie that lacked a proper story, but honestly I was surprised.Elemental was a beautiful movie to watch, with a gorgeous soundtrack to back the art and animation seen. The story and characters were amazing with plenty of scenes mixed in to both make me laugh and cry throughout the whole production. Not only that, but there was a clear amount of thought and intelligence that went into the development of the film with how the different ""elements"" of the characters would mix with the world they are in such as how water characters, such as Wade Ripple, would phase into and join with the water of the world.A lot of the movies I see now, especially animated ones, seem to be following a pattern of the studio wanting to show off how beautiful their animation styles are, therefore taking away extra precious seconds from the story that are needed to make amazing movies. Two other animatedheavily CGI'd movies I watched more recently were Avatar 2: Way of Water and Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse, in which I felt like both movies spent too much time showing off their stunning visuals and animation, and unfortunately forgetting to focus on the story. Looking back on some of the classic Disney movies such as Snow White, Cinderella (1950) and even more modern films such as Tangled, the art styles were much more simplistic but carried amazing stories along with them. Elemental itself fell victim to this new trend with some short, snappy scenes feeling like they should have just been that extra few seconds longer to really make this movie truly spectacular.This is one of the few movies I have seen recently I definitely want to return to the big screen to rewatch which is what gives it an 810 for me.",2

DisneyPixar voice casted extremely well. No character disappointed whatsoever.Without spoiling the deeper meaning of the film, there is no other lighthearted film like this showing us a devastating parallel to our how we view, judge, and treat others today while providing a gleam of hope that there is a brighter side of the world we can embrace.With that said, the reviews I've read so far provide a negative stance about the storyline and visuals. Perhaps this storyline has been retold but so has everything these days with multiple Spider-Man movies with the exact same storyline and most other films being retold and recycled and updated for today basically. This film was not that!This film provides hope and meaning for a better future with a beautiful story and with the best characters. Art comes in many forms. This film provided us a gift that should be commended.Lastly, The visuals were very detailed with Fire and Water and an entire city. Not sure what to complain about. You cannot compare what they did with Spider Verse to this. It's a totally different approach to filmmaking. Let's go people - enjoy this heartwarming film allowing us time to realize we aren't that important individually and better together.Only gripe would provide a spoiler alert but let's just say some of the characters' emotions were exaggerated a bit.",0

Hats off to all those who created this masterpiece.I am really a huge fan of Disney. Yesterday on Father's Day, my family and I saw this movie in 3D. This is one of the best Disney Pixar film for this year so far. It was so colourful, beautiful, amazing, emotional and stunning.Of course, Disney and Disney Pixar won't let us down because Disney have been creating these types of beautiful stories for generations to show how it would bring to the reality life. At the same time, we feel the emotions to the characters, the musics in those kinds of stories when we see it. This film meant a lot to me and my family. Disney stories brings wonders and to our attention that we don't feel lonely in a dark space. The characters were phenomenal and amazing. The voices of the characters were amazing and greatBasically, this beautiful story is all about the elements of nature from their home place called The Element City and more of a Periodic Table. The elements are Air, Water, Earth and Fire that show how they are mixed together by making it true. It is related to all Disney Pixar and Disney Studio films. There is so much magic and love to this film. Elemental is similar to Zootopia, the reason why because the characters have that personality of them.",0

135,136,2.0,3.0,anabellavitelli,2023-07-20,"This is a rip-off of Zootopia, and a bad one too. The whole point of the film was to see elements work together to save a problem. However, it became all about a mushy relationship supposedly breaking the norms of their society, where fire isn't allowed to socialize with water. Most of the movie is set in the span of a week and the main characters ""love"" is not believable. They declare their love to each other without getting to know who they really were.There are also several issues with the characters and how they physically work. In one of the first scenes of the film the main man goes through a pipe with all the other water and he slowly forms himself after bursting through. So with the information we can tell the elements can be absorbed into one another, however, when characters of water and fire elements hug with their respective elements or make any interaction with each other they suddenly don't have the property like they did before.Next, it's hard to believe that these two characters are the first people to ever touch their hands together and find out nothing bad happens. It's classic main character things, just like how since she's the main character suddenly the town who swore to hate fire dosent care that she is there as long as she has her hood on. Also, why can't Disney let a character die? They have to make something be able to happen so that they can live, it's nonsense. Not every movie has to have a happy ending, even for Disney.In the end it's a bad film and isn't somehting I would think a small kid would like to watch. It's more of a romantic movie than anything. It has errors in its core idea and lacks the only thing that Zootopia had going for it. A good plot. I wouldn't watch again even if it was the only thing on. It's pointless and adds nothing good to the brand of Disney.",0
136,137,5.0,9.0,tommastaldi,2023-07-19,"Critics that say this movie ""struggles to ignite"" and is conceptually flawed to the core which makes it impossible to enjoy, did not watch the same movie I did. I wouldn't put it up there with the absolute best Pixar movies (Wall-e will always and forever be my number 1), but saying this movie is downright bad just highlights your blandness and stupidity.1) The core concept is not the only thing that matters in a movie. Cars has a meh concept, but it's still an incredibly enjoyable movie with an important message, as well as being a love letter to americana. Elemental's concept is flawed, true, but the way it is executed makes the mistakes and inconsistencies much easier to ignore.2) The romance is virtually flawless and is just SO compelling and enjoyable. It had been so long since we had a Disney-Pixar movie focus primarily on romance, and this was the perfect movie to resuscitate the romance category by making it the most thought out and realistic romance we ever saw in a Pixar movie.3) The animation is godly. Period.4) Even the weakest part of the movie, the firetown flood, is still used to develop the blossoming romance between Ember and Wade to its final step: them becoming an actual couple.5) This movie's portrayal of discrimination is surprisingly similar to real life, with fire people being submitted to discrimination, violence, segregation, microaggressions, and racial slurs, all in a way that feels grounded in the movie's universe.6) The portrayal of different cultures and cultural fusions is so good. Fire people have an entirely different language, they have their own rituals and religions. Water people (the most privileged in Element City) also have a well thought-out culture. Air people have an entire sport dedicated to them only, and all elements are free to attend. When Wade waters down the Kol-nuts (to the outrage of Ember's father Burnie) because it makes them easier to eat, you can see the real life parallel in westernised asian foods, which are made more palatable to western palates despite being bland or inedible by eastern standards.This movie was made with care, love, passion, and it comes out as incredibly enjoyable.

139,140,4.0,7.0,Pjtaylor-96-138044,2023-07-18,"Though not particularly memorable and far from its studio's best, 'Elemental (2023)' is an entertaining and emotionally resonant animated feature centered around immigration. It deals with themes of integration, independence and family, focusing on a second-generation fire person who struggles to repay the sacrifice her parents made when they left their home behind to seek a better life for their then unborn child. The protagonist soon meets a water person and learns that maybe elements can mix after all, which is where the movie pivots into being a relatively sweet romance. The immigration elements are more compelling than the romantic ones, but the story does a good job of tying them together. The piece also comments on how the institutions of its setting have done little to aid the integration of the fire community and have actually actively failed its inhabitants, too. The picture bites a fair amount off and it can typically chew it all, even if it does spit a little here and there. Its metaphors perhaps don't stand up to intense scrutiny, especially if you're expecting them to carry the weight of a one-to-one comparison, but they work well in establishing the flick's generally underexplored themes (at least, underexplored in movies of this type). The picture isn't content to dumb down the complexities of its subject, either, and it makes it clear that the very real conflict brewing within its hero doesn't necessarily have an easy answer, even if it also aims to wrap things up in a way a broad audience can both understand and be reassured by. It feels like a fairly personal story for the filmmakers, and it's easy to see it resonating deeply with its intended audience. Sadly, it seems a lot of people have simply not seen it and those who have are generally underwhelmed. For me, this is better than a lot of animated fare principally because it never talks down to its audience and remains entertaining for its duration. It's certainly not the best animation to be released this year (far from it), but it's more than serviceable stuff that's as fun as it is touching. I will say that it doesn't quite have the universal appeal of Pixar's best work, as there isn't actually all that much for the youngest in the crowd to grab on to (and there are some bizarrely inappropriate, tonally jarring jokes here and there, too). Still, this is a more-than-solid effort that proves Pixar still have something in the tank.",0

There's a distance between a child and father's dreams-solved quickly with a little communication. Father is an understanding and loving fellow.

In saying that, Elemental is a prime example of enhancing the formula. If one allows themselves to remove any expectation, they'll be rewarded with valuable life lessons on racism, bigotry, self-esteem  identity, dealing with expressing emotions healthily, and far more.On the topic of expression, the visuals are next-to-none in the world of CGI animation. Every detail - from each elemental figure and beyond - is breath-taking, smooth and hypnotizing. It's the kind of thing that brings a tear to the eye.Adding to the gold standard of the film is the soundtrack.

Fortunately, the film itself is still fun enough and children themselves will really ignore this. The animation is what you would expect from DisneyPixar, standard and never takes any kind of risk. The jokes vary from lame to a single chuckle moment, but real thigh talk really stays out. Anyone who really expects a sequel or a clone of Inside Out will be disappointed. That can of course be seen as a positive, because that way you don't get a repetition of moves, of course, but unfortunately Inside Out is really much more fun than this film. The melancholy sounds of composer Thomas Newman are really beautiful, but they don't fit at all with an animated film like this. For the rest, Elemental has become quite a fun film and you will not be bored if you pierce through the points indicated, because why do socially critical notes always have to be laid in this kind of film, especially as flashy as that happens here.

146,147,3.0,6.0,jboothmillard,2023-07-16,"DisneyPixar had successfully created characters from human emotions in Inside Out and explored the inner essence of the human being in Soul, I recognised from the trailer that this next animation was focusing on the world of elements (think The Fifth Element), directed by Peter Sohn (Partly Cloudy, The Good Dinosaur). Basically, it is all set in a fantasy world, where characters embody one of the four elements: fire, water, earth, and air. Fire elements Bernie (Ronnie Del Carmen) and Cinder Lumen (Shila Ommi) have immigrated to Element City, where they face xenophobia from other elements and struggle to find a home. They eventually find a run-down store which they rebuild and establish a convenience store called the Fireplace. There, they have their daughter, Ember, set up a Blue Flame that represents their heritage and traditions, and the store becomes popular with many fire element customers over time. When she grows up, Bernie intends to give the store to Ember (Leah Lewis) when he retires, but he feels she is not ready as she has a fiery temper she must control. When Bernie allows Ember to look after the shop alone, she becomes overwhelmed by the customers and rushes to the basement. She has a fiery outburst, causing a water pipe to burst, flooding the basement. At the same time, water element and city inspector Wade Ripple (Mamoudou Athie) appears, after being sucked into the water pipe. Wade notes the faulty plumbing and reluctantly leaves for City Hall to send a report to his air element employer, Gale Cumulus (Wendi McLendon-Covey). The violation could mean that the Fireplace will have to be shut down. Ember chases Wade through Element City but is too late. Wade takes pity on Ember, so takes her to meet Gale at the Cyclone Stadium to convince her to reconsider the shutdown of the store. Wade mentions he was investigating recurring flooding outside the area before ending up at the Fireplace, Gale gives the duo a tight deadline to find the source of the floods. If they manage to seal the leak, then the violations will be forgiven. Wade and Ember search the canals for the source of the leak. Wade tells Ember he believes her temper comes from her trying to tell herself something that she is not ready to accept, which she denies. They discover a hole in a dam located near a shipyard that is causing the leak, so they close the hole with sandbags. Meanwhile, Bernie deals with water leaks all over the Fireplace. Wade and Ember spend time together in the city and learn more about each other. Later, Wade tells Ember that the sandbags did not work. They return to the dam, where Ember uses her glassmaking ability to create a sturdier seal for the hole. Meanwhile, Cinder suspects Ember is seeing someone and follows her. Ember has been invited by Wade to meet his family at their luxury apartment. Ember is greeted by Wade's mother Brook (Catherine O'Hara), his older brother Alan (Matt Yang King), and his uncle Harold (Ronobir Lahiri). During dinner, a glass pitcher is broken, which Ember fixes with her fire abilities, impressing Brook who recommends her for a glassmaking internship. The family and Ember play the ""crying game"", where they must make each other; Wade successfully makes Ember cry when he admits he has feelings for her. Wade receives a call from Gale that she approves of the glass seal and the Fireplace has avoided closure. But Ember realises that she does not want to take over the store after all. When Ember returns to the Fireplace, Bernie announces he will retire and that he feels she is ready to be handed the store. He tells Ember that when he and Cinder left their homeland, he bowed to his father, but his father refused to bow back. Earlier, Ember mentioned to Wade that she wanted to see Vivisteria flowers at Garden Central Station when she was a child, they can grow in all conditions and habitats, but she never got to see them. With the station now flooded, Gale places Ember into an air bubble for safety while Wade takes her underwater through the station to see the flowers. Returning to the surface, Wade and Ember realise that they are able to touch without harming each other and share a romantic dance. But Ember is reminded she has a duty to the Fireplace and that her family is prejudiced against water elements, she leaves and upsets Wade. A party is held to celebrate Bernie's retirement and Ember is about to take over the Fireplace. But Wade appears and professes his love for her, but also lets it slip that she caused the broken pipe. Ember rejects Wade, but Cinder senses genuine affection. Disappointed, Bernie decides not to retire and denies Ember the store. Soon after, the glass seal at the dam breaks and the fire district is flooded. Ember and Wade save the Blue Flame in the Fireplace but become trapped in a room. When the flood recedes, Ember is grief-stricken Ember as the enclosed heat has caused Wade to evaporate. She confesses to her father that she does not want to run the store and expresses her love for Wade. Realising water drops of Wade remain on the stone, Ember plays the crying game to get him to drip back into his normal form. Ember reciprocates Wade's affection, and they kiss. Months later, Wade and Ember are a couple, they leave Element City so Ember can study glassmaking far away and travel the world together. Before she boards the ship, Ember bows to Bernie who returns the gesture. Also starring Mason Wertheimer as Clod, Wilma Bonet as Flarrietta, Joe Pera as Fern, and Matthew Yang King as Lutz. The elements as characters are cleverly weaved together, it is simplistic Romeo and Juliet style love story where opposites attract, there is an immigration theme in the background, and the father-daughter relationship is the more interesting. The quality animation is brilliantly colourful, most of the character design is mostly well done, the main narrative lacks emotional depth, but it manages to pull you in with its charm, a fun computer-animated romantic comedy-drama.

Also, it bites off a little bit more than it can chew; the core theme is well done, but it has a few other thematic ideas floating around that don't really satisfyingly develop.It's an enjoyable time overall, and seems to be getting over hated for some reason.

A good story requires an aspect of redeeming social value, and Ember's struggles with anger management provides that element here.

That it takes so long for Ember and Wade to try to touch each other and found it wouldn't hurt but instead creating something new is...touching but begs the question: none has tried before?",0
151,152,4.0,8.0,ibrahim-abdalaziz,2023-07-14,"The movie itself deserves a solid 6.5  10 rating. The story is decent and has its good moments, but unfortunately falls into the predictable category of romantic comedies. However, what truly elevated the film for me was its theme song, which I have to give a +3 boost to my overall rating, bringing it up to an impressive 9.5  10.I cannot quite put my finger on it, but there was something incredibly moving about the song that really struck a chord with me. It made my eyes well up with tears and left me with a lingering feeling of warmth and tenderness. The combination of the song and the film's story was truly heartwarming, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a sweet and charming rom-com. While the story may be predictable, the theme song alone is worth the watch, and will leave you feeling touched and uplifted. I truly loved this movie and the emotional response it evoked in me, and I am sure many others will feel the same.",0

Heck, we had just been to In-N-Out, so our expectations were low (but solidly low).I had heard the movie was a tear jerker, but I was not suspecting the deep layers of storytelling on hand. For example, the immigrant story from a US perspective is something. Imagine leaving your homeland to make a new life, risks and all, in a place where you were not necessarily respected. That's Elemental.And then you fall in love with someone who your parents did not expect.Wow.Was it perfect? No. The movie kept telling us about timelines and the mostly ignore the deadlines. Three days? Seven days? Whatever. I think it could have used some touching up in those areas. Overall, it is a movie about how similar we all are in spite of our differences.

The element setting is also represented in personality differences and living environments. In terms of creating a fantasy world, Elemental is stunning.The arrangement and portrayal of the characters are also well done. With five main characters, each has different personalities and appearances, and are portrayed vividly and naturally. However, the depth of the characters is far from sufficient. Character motivation and character development are lacking, with which it's difficult to evoke deeper emotions from the audience.The storyline is quite conventional and not groundbreaking at all, which is okay if the movie handles it well. In Elemental, here are some major storyline or issues, hardships of leaving hometown, the regret of not receiving recognition from elders, the burden of inheriting a family business, the struggle to find oneself, and the sparks of romance across factions, etc. However, Elemental handles these plotlines and issues somewhat roughly, even haphazardly.Take inheriting the family business and the pursuit of self-discovery for example. The protagonist was eager to inherit the family business in the first place, but suddenly, without any obvious reason, she felt the need to fulfill her talent and pursue her own path. Such rough arrangements make the already weak plot more fragile.Overall, it is a film where the audio and visual effects outshine the character portrayals, storyline and issue discussion.",0
156,157,5.0,10.0,ergo-58534,2023-07-12,"Elemental is a beautiful and charming animated film from Disney and Pixar that tells the story of Ember and Wade, two elements of fire and water who fall in love despite their differences. The film is set in Element City, a vibrant and diverse metropolis where elements of air, earth, water and fire coexist and work together. Ember is a fiery and adventurous woman who lives in Firetown, a district full of warmth and energy. Wade is a calm and gentle man who lives in Watertown, a district full of tranquility and harmony. When Wade accidentally floods a convenience store owned by Ember's father, Bernie, he meets Ember for the first time and sparks fly between them. However, their relationship faces many challenges, such as their families' disapproval, their incompatible lifestyles, and the dangers of mixing fire and water. Will they be able to overcome these obstacles and find happiness together?Elemental is a delightful and touching film that celebrates the themes of diversity, acceptance, and love. The film is directed by Peter Sohn, who previously helmed The Good Dinosaur, and written by Sohn, John Hoberg, Kat Likkel, and Brenda Hsueh. The film features an amazing voice cast, including Leah Lewis as Ember, Mamoudou Athie as Wade, Ronnie del Carmen as Bernie, Shila Ommi as Cinder, Ember's mother, Wendi McLendon-Covey as Gale, Wade's boss, Catherine O'Hara as Brook, Wade's mother, Mason Wertheimer as Clod, Ember's earth neighbor, and Joe Pera as Fern, an overgrown city bureaucrat. The film also boasts a stunning animation style that brings Element City to life with vivid colors, textures, and details. The film showcases the unique characteristics of each element, such as the fluidity of water, the brightness of fire, the solidity of earth, and the lightness of air. The film also uses clever visual metaphors to illustrate the emotions of the characters, such as Ember's hair changing color according to her mood, or Wade's body evaporating when he is nervous. The film also has a wonderful score by Thomas Newman that captures the mood and tone of each scene.Elemental is a masterpiece of animation that deserves 10 stars out of 10.",2

After a very long time hearing a refreshing background music in Hollywood movies. So much thought process was put in the movie which was clearly shown on the screen. I was looking for how Fire and Water will react, what fire can do, water can do. Not just story but lot of scientific research was made to make it as realistic as possible. There is comedy, sentiment and a good message to society. Kudos to the director for coming up with a such nice subject. I recommend everyone to watch this movie with your family.",2

Ember starts to realise things about herself, and starts too fall for Wade. But fire and water? Together?On the face of it, this is a fantasy romance about two apparently ill-matched characters, against a background of several intertwined subplots, all of which add action, suspense, and prejudice. The story works perfectly well (although you can forget earth and air characters, who are more or less irrelevant).The film, of course, looks fantastic. What we see is not remotely possible, but there it is, and it's beautiful.As usual with Pixar, there is a subtext, and this time it's about being true to yourself, which applies here in a number of different ways and contexts.Ember's temper means that she's not always likeable, and this is a difficulty the film has to work to overcome (Bernie's blindness to anything except his personal vision) is also an irritation.

But I can tell you're different from him At first glance, this movie may have reminded you of the fire and water platform game. But the producers said it had nothing to do with it.

160,161,4.0,7.0,quiqueperezsoler,2023-07-11,"To say the world of Elemental is a not-so-subtle allegory of real life wouldn't be an overstatement. To say the themes and plot points explored in this movie diverted a bit of the typical rom-com and immigrant family struggles wouldn't be an oversimplification. I liked this movie, and I think everyone will too. What's not to like?The animation style is unique and virbrant, mixing 3D and 2D fitting the trend Spiderverse began; the characters are charming, the story endearing and the world stunning and.. a tad underdeveloped. I know what this movie is trying to do, it is attempting this mix between real-life allegory prejudices from Zootopia and metaphysical introspective foud in Inside Out. However, it fails at nailing what these two succeeded at doing:Zootopia made the effort to establish the pillars of how society worked. Surely the nature of the members of its society (animals) themselves explained most of the prejudices and ""class distinction"", but the environments and cities were explored in a montage to a certain extent to explore a bit how these different creatures lived together. Here, there are so many obvious questions unanswered that it becomes distracting. You don't need to explain every single rule of how the world works but you still have to establish the grounds for an understandable story. I know the director drew inspiration from his childhood and his parents childhood into the story, and that's why I like it, it feels personal, it feels like I'm being let into the past and the heart of someone who cares. That's why it's more frustrating when some elements presented weren't explored or developed enough to make sense out of everything. So many questions needed to establish the backstory of this world and family: what was this other place the father had to leave from? How is it connected to the Elemental City? Are they the first immigrant family in the Elemental city? Are each element a different race? Why did they move to an abandoned neighborhood, and why was it abandoned? If the world was an allegory of New York or America, why is there only one-sided racism towards fire? I know it makes sense when talking about elements but do other couples combine too? Can they? Will they? The story seems to have a lot of firsts that the setting (inspired by the modern day) doesn't correlate to, if this allegory of the world we live in was as 1 to 1 as the movie presents it to be; this idea becomes a bit anachronistic.If the fire people are seemingly the immigrants who are not given any help to settle in the Elemental society, are other elements being prejudiced against? And it is just unfortunate because I really believe there are some nuggets of good ideas but the script never takes any chances with it. In turn, every element becomes the most average version of itself: the rom com tropes feel retraced, the relationships father-daughter familiar and stereotyped, the family of the boyfriend somehow white-guilt-tripped.Not to mention the character arcs. Amber has so much potential in the first half of the movie, boyfriend is a bit annoying but his heart is in the right place. But this is Amber's story, mostly because the boyfriend never had any motivation outside his job and her, he is a blank slate, and that's okay because Amber is the main protagonist. And what a waste. And mostly, her emotional moments were robbed from her: We never saw that Amber wanted to do something other than owning her father's shop, we never knew she wanted to do glass sculpting until bf's mom told her she should do it, and even then she thought no other alternative is to be thought off, only choice is the store; we never saw a inner conflict of her finding her true calling, she just ""stumbled upon it"", and when it was time for her to be honest with her dad, it was her bf who robbed her of that confession, he forced her to tell him in the worst possible time (in a bad way); she should have confessed that herself, out of courage and with the hope that her dad would understand and respect her choice; not to mention her dad never really lears to accept water people, we only learn he accepts her choice of not taking care of the shop. He never has a heart to heart with the one member of the society who has proven him the water people may not be that bad.No only that, but during her entire upbringing, Amber was always shown excited to take care of the shop, we never thought she'd be intrigued in pursuing another career path, she went straight to what her father taught her. And then when we see she may not have the patience to deal with bad customers, this could have been a great opportunity to challenge her to be better. Or what I thought would actually happen, that her bf, who was shown to be good at expressing his feelings and hyping up people, would be the one with whom she would learn to cool down and not stress. The element's natural essence work wonders for this concept, she is fire so she can get irritated and blow up, but water is calming and soothing, he could have been the perfect element to combine with.Unfortunately, the story was too focused on the particular themes it wanted to explore, too personal to the artist to let us into the world they created. The world-building was lacking because the story and characters were more important, and that's fine, but then the world of the elements is wasted in its conceptual potential. This story would have been completely fine as a live action or in a world with people. Zootopia had an overarching plot, a detective case used as a backdrop of their story, a way for the main characters to explore every aspect of the society they had presented. And applying prejudices and commentary on our current society.The few emotional payoffs do not hit as hard because the story never delves into the intricaccies of any of the themes it presents. It tackles all of them well enough, but it feels shallow as we never get to see how certain prejudices or preconceptions affects the world around them. We learn the water people are actually the ""high class"" but we never see what the other elements are, and it's not like you can tell right away based on elemental hierarchy because there is no preestablished hierarchy like we can find in the Animal kingdom. The movie rushes through everything and never takes a moment to breath, to settle in the notions it establishes. If anything, the biggest emotional payoff was the salute betwen daughter and father at the end, harkening back to the flashback scene with the dad. It's just that movies like Turning Red have represented this aspect of mix-cultures better than in this movie,The movie doesn't know what it wants to be, it starts being a ""passing the baton"" from father to daughter where she must prove she is up to the task, then finds a conflict in that she must calm down in order to do a good job and then she worries about fixing the water fissure so that her dad doesn't learn that the pipes bursting was her fault even though it wasn't her fault because it was the water dam who was at fault so it wasn't really her fault; and yet later suddenly is told she is good at doing glassware and she suddenly decides to leave and.... I just, don't understand the correlation between any of the resolutions of this story. I know on paper they make sense how things ""could"" be connected, but we never see them connect.Again, my conclusion to this movie is, I applaud PIXAR for not doing a sequel and creating a new style and world; it says a lot about their capacity to create new worlds and the animation is amazing; it's just that the story retreaded a lot of familiar beats, never trying to tell something new or use its unique world to flesh out new ideas and concepts. I can see the story had personal significance to the director and I'd love to see more of these sort of personal stories and unique perspectives about society; just make sure you also deliver an impactful climax and emotionally resonating but also well-fleshed out pay-offs. But definitely this is the better path for a better PIXAR.",1
161,162,5.0,9.0,Elvis-Del-Valle,2023-07-10,"Elemental is quite a different movie than anything Pixar has brought us before because of the animation and character style. It feels like a different movie, but it has that Pixar style of storytelling. It is a story of an ipossible romance that little bu little grows and leads Ember Lumen to discover that her task of taking her father's place is perhaps not what destiny has in store for her. Upon meeting Wade Ripple, Ember discovers much more about herself. The plot is simple, but it serves its purpose. The idea of using characters made up of the four most known elements makes the movie feel like something new that hasn't been done before. Even many of these characters make the film look surreal, adding the amazing animation that makes it visually masterful. The idea of an impossible romance between a woman of fire and a man of water gives the film a poetic touch. Ember's fire ends up being symbolic of her frustration and inner conflict. Wade's water becomes a symbolism of his sensitivity, and that is why it is not uncommon to see him cry. It is a couple made up of a conflicting woman and a sensitive man. Even the idea that the elements are not compatible becomes an allegory with respect to inequality, and it is more evident when seeing the distrust that Ember's father has towards the people of water. The plot has good potential to be a great love story, and if it had been a much more dramatic love story in the style of movies like Titanic or Our Fault in Our Stars, it would certainly have been an excellent romantic movie. Elemental is an enjoyable movie that derives from what is already known about Pixar, and that makes it a unique movie that deserves a chance. My final, unique and valid rating for this film is 910.",0

165,166,4.0,7.0,melonhulkhead,2023-07-09,"Elemental has all of the components that make a movie a great watch: gorgeous visuals, solid voice acting, an impressive score and an engaging romance. Obviously it's Pixar so it's gonna excell with the animation and textures of this new large world to explore. The voice cast wasn't anything special but did a very good job with the (occasionally generic) script given to them. The music was also actually very good with a couple of pop songs we've all heard and a few new ones that fit the tone of the movie aswell.The romance was definitely the highlight of this movie. So the whole point is that both protagonists are from opposite communities and have the whole ""hedgehog effect"" (the closer they get the more they hurt eachother) obviously due to one being fire and the other water. This sounds very basic and not anything that unique yet I couldn't help actually feel engaged by their relationship with eachother. They're both fairly likeable characters with certain personalities that help create quite a fun level of chemistry. It also does feel quite natural with how they become more comfortable with eachother for the first half of the movie. I could see the argument that maybe it felt a little bit rushed but it still worked nonetheless. The only issue I had was their relationship was during the third act of the movie which had the cliche ""I love you but we shouldn't be together"" conflict. Obviously it made sense with the type of characters they were but the argument just felt completely out of nowhere which almost made my eyes roll.Also surprisingly the comedy was very good for the most part. Wade turned out to be hilarious and the line deliveries within these scenes were great. He also had a large amount of visual comedy which somehow got me laughing more than anything else. However outside of Wade the rest of the movie lacked with the comedic side. There were a couple of moments that made me chuckle with characters such as Ember and Wade's family but there wasn't really much else.One of the problems for me was the dialogue especially between Ember and Wade. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever heard but it felt so generic and sometimes cringeworthy during certain scenes.The story was also admittedly a bit all over the place. There were many times when we would go from one scene to another with little build up so it would feel quite unnatural and random. There were also entire scenes which just felt completely irrelevant even if stuff like the visuals or comedy was really good. There's a scene later in the movie where Wade and Ember are travelling around an area with really nice visuals but it just felt stretched out for the sake of ""looking good"". It did nothing for either of the characters and seemed to only be there to move on to the next scene.Characters were also a bit of a hit or miss. Really the only highlights are Ember, Wade, Ember's Dad and that's probably about it. Everyone else just kinda showed up and left in the next scene. Nobody else felt very relevant to the plot nor were they actually very entertaining to watch (outside of Wade's family who got out a few laughs). Even Wade, the secondary protagonist, didn't have that interesting of a character. Sure he was fun but he had a lack of depth.So to sum it up, Elemental is a pretty good romcom with great visuals and surprisingly good music. It had a somewhat generic (yet enjoyable) plot with few memorable characters outside of the 2 protagonists. 710 maybe a 6.510 but the animation was just that good.",0
166,167,4.0,8.0,KFstudios2009,2023-07-09,"Elemental. If I have to be honest, I wasn't sure about this movie at first. It looked simple, and the trailers didn't make such impression. But then I saw the movie, and I mean, it is the best animated movie from 2023 so far. It was way better than the Peter Pan remake from this year, that was terrible, and I am happy that Disney are finally making something original.The story take place in Element City, where water, earth, air and fire lives among each other. We are focusing on a character called Ember (That is a fire girl) and she is going to take over her fathers shop. But then she discovers a water-boy called Wade and they fell in love. The biggest issue of this movie is that Ember have to find out who she is and that elements can't mix.I enjoyed the movie very well. It was very good animation, it was amazing! The dynamic, expression and color was very well made. Great dialogues and the characters was introduced good. I was floating good across the movie and I was all focused, I was waiting for what is coming next, but I think the movie could be 10 minutes shorter. But it is not a big deal, I think after all it is completely fine.The main characters were great, too. Wade and Ember were such a cute couple together, it was very nice to look at them together. Wade was a sensitive, but at the same time brave, funny guy, and Ember was a nice, cute girl and she was caring about her family. Even if 85% was about them, we got a look at the other characters, like Wades family and Embers.The moral was very deep and learning. This movie showed how the perspective of different cultures can be, that you have to follow your dreams and your heart, that love is the most important thing in life, and that everyone can change if you are nice to them. If you are nice to others, then the others will be nice to you.Fantastic movie, should you watch it in 3D or 4Dx? I think it isn't necessary. This movie is a great experience anyway, some of the animations in the movie looked actually very 3D, and the movie itself is completely fine to watch without the extra effects. Recommend this for everyone, family-friendly, check. Great story, check. Great animation, check. Great experience, check.

What I liked about Elemental was it's immigration story because it showed the struggles of Ember's parents had to go through when they moved to Element City. They had to suffer from prejudice and had to work hard to have a establish a life for themselves. The opening five minutes was excellent work from Pixar as it told a mini story about Ember's story arriving in the city. There were also an excellent look at how immigrant communities keep a hold of their culture and how their children live in too worlds. However, other parts of the film weren't so well thought out because the chemistry between the main two characters was lacking and the theme of prejudice wasn't so strong since there were genuine reasons for fire and water people to fear each other.

I kind of understand why Disney do these films that tie into real world issues and I think it's an obligation to keep kids innocent and accepting which is their nature, the only reason of the negativity is how they get influenced, so I guess the people hating are the ones who don't like acceptance, inclusivity etc. I think it was mild, not too aggressive and handled well and sadly it's poignant because adults still behave awfully.The characters were great, I like how they used unknown people for the voices and I like how it's treating kids as mature and not making it babyish. The animation is perfect as always, the world is very similar to other Pixar films but there's kinda limited stuff to do with that.

It sure was a little before the end, heand part of the third act is amazing....and my god!The art direction of this film is perfect.I liked how the more scientific things were presented in the form of children's animation, in addition to funny ideas, they are really good jokes!As a Brazilian and seeing the film dubbed (Brazilian Portuguese), I feel that I can enact the incredible dubbing! The slang and everything else is great in the movie!Good and just fun, but not really exciting as the title of this review says. I believe it is worth seeing in theaters with the family!",0

We both caught each other making the biggest grins at each other during Elemental. I was blown away by the animation, but I felt personally connected to the cast and that's where Elemental did everything right. They brought a beautiful story and made it even better. Pixar is proving to be one of, if not the best animation studio out there. Because Elemental did not have the box office start Pixar wanted and what we the fans have found was an instant cult classicfavorite. Critics claim this movie is too repetitive, been done too many times, please do not take a low grade from a critic seriously. Listen to those of us who have not lost the magic of going to the movies. This story has never been told with the characteristics of our main characters in mind. I honestly hope to see a sequel or a short series that goes into the life of Ember and Wade. Imagine their offspring! A little steamy baby has already got me excited about any possibilities. I am sincerely hoping for a quick transition to Disney + simply because of how infatuated I am with this story. If you are contemplating spending the money or waiting. I strongly recommend spending your weekend watching this movie. I may be going again before the weekend is up!",4

175,176,4.0,8.0,mrnickheath,2023-07-08,"I grow so tired of reading reviews of films such as this, from critics that cannot possibly give an even view of ANY movie, given that they must watch 10 a week. So having now seen it I can't understand how anyone could say it's ""so boring and unmemorable that it seems like a new low"". I suppose those journos are just trying to make an ""edgy"" name for themselves.So to the film, the animation is exceptional, details like the wooden ramp that the Fire Family come down at the beginning are amazing, and I do sometimes wonder at what point it stops being animation, and just starts to be an attempt to recreate the real world.However it's beautiful, and the city has amazing attention to detail. The premise has been done, An American Tail a case in point, so I just see past that, and allowed Myself to simply enjoy.The character builds are good, likeable and well done. I didn't see the point of the Fireish language as it occupies a very small part of the film therefore feels a little to self conscious.But anyway, there is colour, fun, excitement and I cried twice, then unexpectedly got caught a third time at the end credits with the tributes.It's a love story. Simple as that. It's gorgeously animated, lovely music, and is simply there to be enjoyed, not to change the world.",0
177,178,4.0,7.0,bm230199,2023-07-07,Elemental was a sweet and heartwarming story and although it won't go down as one of Disney's greats it was still memorable. I think my favourite thing was the subtle themes of diversity and inclusivity throughout as well as the very relevant storyline of certain people being excluded from society simply for being different. It can work on many levels and I thought this movie would be an excellent way to introduce young children to these issues similar to how Inside Out was utilised. The main characters were sweet and the voice actors did a good job to give them vivid personalities. The animators did an excellent job as some scenes were just STUNNING and I loved how the fire characters weren't just orange but actually moved like a flame even when standign still. That must've been hard to annimate but they did any amazing job. To summarise: Visually stunning sweet story about the struggle of cast-out members of society.,4
178,179,4.0,8.0,yellowmarlin,2023-07-07,"Elemental is a beautiful and touching love letter to immigrant communities around the world. It touches on the hopes and fears of those who go in search of a better life in a new land, and the heartbreak of leaving loved ones behind, possibly to never see them again. It illustrates the cruel discrimination suffered by immigrant communities everywhere, the wounded bigotry festering as a consequence and the casual racism uttered by even those who are friendly and welcoming. And it focusses on the weight of cultural and familial pressures and expectations heaped on the shoulders of the children of those who came before. Yes, there's also a love story, but that's not what this movie is about.",1
179,180,4.0,8.0,cdjh-81125,2023-07-07,"Elemental is big step up from the recent slump Pixar's been in for me recently. Turning Red did next to nothing for me, to the point where I didn't even feel like I could give it a rating, and while Lightyear isn't what I'd call bad it was certainly disappointing based upon how excited I was for it. Elemental may rely on tropes we've seen from this studio before but it's presented in such an energetic and visually dazzling way that it more than makes up for those familiarities.The world and character designs are really fantastic and it's never not visually dynamic, it's got such a good sense of humour to it with a really strong emotional core that it never loses sight of. The themes of personal growth and generational trauma clearly come from a really personal perspective and it's got plenty of moments with that signature Pixar gut punch.I will say that that story isn't exactly the films strongest asset. It can be a bit all over the place and tries too hard to put itself in to a few too many genres and there's a particularly out of place sub plot that involves a sort off world ending mechanism that kind off took away from the more intimate character moments that I was enjoying a lot more.Elemental isn't the best movie in Pixar's catalogue but it's certainly my favourite thing they've done in the last few years. For better or worse it has that classic Pixar feel and the best thing I can say about it is that it did genuinely make me feel something. I really hope they doesn't rush this to Disney+ because I actually think it could have decent legs at the box office after a slow start. A pleasant surprise for me that I absolutely think is worth seeing in a theatre.",1

They just added some more colors etc and made a movie with a weird story line.I dont think there is a need for children to see a love story in whatever context they are making it. There should be a story line which is less awkward to go and see with your kids.I know they will grow up and eventually explore life and everything that comes with it but there are things that should have some limits.Such a weird and awkward movie to see with your kids. Cartoons are suppose to cartoons and funny. There were only few scenes and jokes which are funny otherwise it was all repetitive and boring.",4
181,182,4.0,8.0,PedroPires90,2023-07-06,"I know that 99% of the world disagrees with me, but this is my favourite animated film so far in 2023.The visuals are incredible, and they don't need to be too flashy or in your face. They just need to present an incredible level of realism in certain details (the water!) and the score (wow!) and soundtrack are pleasant surprises that always blend well with the story.Nevertheless, the great merit of Elemental lies in its two main characters and how they represent the depicted themes. Immigration, racism, prejudice, privilege, segregation, family, expectations, dreams, legacy, identity, friendship, love. It's such a wide and interesting array of themes, and it's amazing that the film does such a great job with all of them. This is a story that will certainly resonate much better with immigrants or those who experience certain types of discrimination. But it's a positive story, always hitting the right tone that makes us laugh and identify with its characters. There's an important subplot that isn't strong enough or even resolved in a satisfactory way, but it's easy to forgive that when we spend 100 minutes with a huge smile on our faces.Ember is a fantastic character and steals the show, encapsulating so many things and being so relatable. She's the one who makes this work so well, not only as a thematically important and entertaining film but also as a beautiful romantic comedy. It doesn't shy away from genre clichés, but it's cozy in the way it reaches its conclusions, never overdoing its preachiness and always with a lot of charm and cool elements.",0

Maybe not the best for little ones....my 5 year old got a little antsy towards the end, but my 10 year old was invested and in tears. It is not a silly movie or action packed, it is full of beauty, wonder, and heart.

184,185,3.0,6.0,alimax-61551,2023-07-06,"The underlying story and message is really good. I just feel it was written well, but executed poorly as a film. Scenes didn't really feel connected or well linked. It just felt like I was jumping to the next part, so the flow wasn't great. Even some of the ways the conflict was set up felt forced and a little random at times. Ember and Wade were food characters and you definitely root for them during the story, but it felt a little rushed at times. I feel like some of the ways the characters felt during a scene was forced just to progress the story and the relationship between the two.If you do watch Elemental, you'll find it to be an ok movie. It definitely is animated well, and the story is good. But they didn't really refine this film well. It felt disconnected and underdeveloped, with everything feeling rushed. This makes the film feel shorter than it is. It had a lot of potential to be good, but they missed the mark here. Still, there's something nice to takeaway from this film. I just feel if it was done correctly, could have been an 8 or 9  10 film.",0

The animation is good but not spectacular, it lacked a spark to achieve something really great. The character design is simple. The voice work of the actors is well done.

187,188,4.0,8.0,cryannorris,2023-07-05,"This movie was an emotional roller coaster with the ups and downs of happy and sadness. It humanized the elements and gave them life to highlight today's society in a different light. This movie featured a coming to America sense to highlight the immigrant struggles of coming to America but with handwork, you can prevail. It also handles the passing of the torch in one's family and how one may be willing to take the torch, but it's not who they are. Ember wanted to form her own life and dreams. It showed the epic struggle for one to get their parent's approval but what got me the most was that it even showed the adults struggle for their parent's approval and not just the children. Pixar captured the elements in a way that only the animators from Pixar can. The script was a little too predictable that s the only reason I can't give it a full 10 stars.

188,189,4.0,7.0,mrplotos,2023-07-04,"Is this film worth watching? Absolutely, as per tradition, pixar hides within its products a message that it wants the more adult viewer to discover, and this is one of the most beautiful values that this production company has been offering for a very long time.On the other hand, I do not agree with those who say that Pixar has lost its magic... even if we are not talking about a masterpiece like Coco and Up, I still see a hint of magic.However, this general opinion should serve as a wake-up call for the production to ensure that this great magic can return in future masterpieces.Regarding the structure of the film... it's 1h 40 min that passes quickly to the viewer thanks to the editing style I liked as much as I liked the attention to detail. The overall stylistic choice didn't blow me away but it's still very acceptable!I'll conclude my thoughts with a scene that really pumped me up XD, the ""cyclone stadium"" scene where you could really feel the electrifying atmosphere inside, even from the cinema seats.Guys, keep supporting this production company that absolutely must not fade away!MRPLOTOS.",0
189,190,5.0,9.0,valen060,2023-07-04,"To start things off, Elemental is a heartfelt movie that parallels the trials and tribulations of pursuing one's passion. While it's no easy feat to transition to a place that's completely different from your original hometown with all of its traditions and beliefs, moving into a new city that is much more diverse and expressive can become more of an opportunity if you know the right people. The one thing that remains are moral values. Director Peter Sohn sure made a movie that was greatly inspired from his parents moving all the way to America from Korea before he was even born. Although Sohn was born and raised in the states, it was his parents who showed him to also not lose sight of his heritage and family traditions.Now the plot tells the story of the Lumens, a husband and wife who traveled from the fire lands to start a new life in the multi-diverse, Element City. Which is entirely inhabited by the four basic elements that are earth, air, fire, and water. The Lumens set up shop in one district and eventually give birth to a daughter named Ember, who dreams of one day running her family's business. However, upon meeting a water-based resident named Wade, Ember's views greatly shift into something she might be truly missing in her life.Compared to past Pixar films, I think Elemental is uniquely different for the studio that combines thematic material, romantic elements, and prejudicial themes woven into one. Newcomers Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as the lead roles Ember and Wade respectively did a splendid job when their characters are thrown into conflict over what really matters. I commend them for giving such believable performances and that they have this chemistry that is a science physically and emotionally. While the character designs and quirks are reminiscent to the emotions of Inside Out, it's the setting and discriminatory nature of these characters that mirror Zootopia.Peter Sohn took it a step forward with this movie compared to his directorial debut called The Good Dinosaur. Unlike that movie, where it went with the theory of dinosaurs having not gone extinct and evolved more than humans, I loved the personal touches he gave in Elemental that reflect his own upbringing and meeting someone to love in the process. Quite frankly, I don't really care what others say about this movie being ""by the numbers"" or ""not being at high standards"" as older Pixar classics or any recent animated hits of theirs. Kids will love it for the humor and whimsical nature of these elemental characters, while adults would find the intense situations relatable to them in terms of acceptance and being true to themselves. I enjoyed it for the experience that can be very real in anyone's lives. Pixar still got it.",6

What I do not understand is the hate, people are upset when Ember wants to chase her own dream and not fallow the one her father set for her. Even though in the end, he told her that she should fallow her own dream and not the one her father set for her. Another hate is when Ember secretly sees Wade without her parents knowing, isn't she in 20s and many Disney princesses and characters did stuff without their parents knowing.

An elemental based city that feels like Zootopia meets Inside Out is a great staring point. And what makes it unique is this whole fire meets water type storyline. But what tied this story together? What is the feel good message or lesson of this film? That's what Pixar viewers really care about.I think the writers found it at the end but rushed to production and didn't live and revise in development long enough. This story starts with a father searching for a better life for the upcoming birth of his daughter, his ember. The whole start of the film builds in that love and relationship. Later in the film we learn his own father didn't support his dream and failed to acknowledge an important cultural act as he set out for the city and the film ended with him being able to provide that meaningful moment to his daughter. That's the core of this story but somewhere along the line this story got lost in an unearned and completely random love story that honestly felt very un-Pixar like. There was even a reference to ""hanky panky"" at the end of this film that felt really strange in a children's film.Had the writers really workshopped this script and spent the necessary time it needed to find the heart of this story, this had true potential. But they got lost in adult concepts and stuff that felt cool. Honestly, had this film been workshopped, we probably would have gotten to go to this internship with Ember in this film, something I had actually really hoped to see. Instead, we'll probably never get that story because of the box office numbers and the issues in this story.",1

This was clearly for an older audience that come from immigrant parents. Not everyone can relate to that and for those that don't, it can come off as preachy. The animation was lovely.

Pixar usually delivers something that is visually appealing to kids with enough emotional heft to hook the parents. The latest release, Elemental, follows the tried and true Pixar formula. Here's whether any elements are special enough for a trip to the theater.Elemental is set in Element City, where Bernie and Cinder arrive to start a new life. They are fire elements and Element City is not set up to accommodate their kind. When Bernie and Cinder's daughter, Ember, attempts to take over the family business, the convenience store in the heart of the fire district, things go spectacularly wrong and threaten to destroy the future of the business and the neighborhood altogether. We also meet Wade, a water element, who helps Ember deal with the problems threatening her family's well-being. Dazzling animation and tear-filled hijinks ensue.Elemental creates a really interesting world in which air, water, earth and fire co-exist. The design of Element City is visually stunning, which is not a surprise considering Pixar's history. The animation and colors of the movie are like a feast for the eyes. The way water looks and moves and the brightness of the fire really enhanced the movie. The story of Elemental is also affecting. This is probably Pixar's most romantic movie. Ember and Wade are very sweet together and their connection makes the movie. Also, there is a theme about the immigrant experience that undergirds the plot. It is kind of heavy-handed but never preachy.Ultimately, Elemental is a dazzling animated film and a deeply-affecting story. There is a nice theme about immigration and familial duty that serves as a foundation for the plot while the rest of the story is sweet and romantic. Children and adults would enjoy this movie alike. Grab a big box of popcorn and brave the elements for a trip to the theater.",0

207,208,4.0,8.0,9603Reviews,2023-06-29,"Recently we went and watched Disney's ""Elemental"", and we've got a bit to say about it!First off, we both loved this movie! The worst thing about this movie is how little we saw about it before hand. ""Elemental"" centers around Ember, a fire elemental immigrant to element city, with a bit of a temper and a ton of pressure to save and take over the family business, and Wade, a water elemental who just so happens to also be an extremely emotional city code inspector.Elemental does very well bringing to light the challenges an immigrant familygroup faces in a new environment, while also making sure it's wrapped up in a cute animated rom-com. The other elements are afraid, hostile, or dismissive when it comes to the the fire district and its people,but it's evened out with the budding romance between your two main characters. It also does very well in showing how important unity is among different groups of people. The art and animation in this one are amazingly done as well! The characters, in our opinion, are all well animated, well designed, and unique enough in their own ways. The animation, as standard with Pixar, is 100% on point.Elemental, however, does lack in a select few areas. The side characters for the air and earth elements were all forgettable. Clod, Fern, Gale, and Lutz are all forgettable. The main characters and their families are well done and fleshed out. But they miss the mark on the backup characters. The story is also, nothing we've never seen before. Obviously it's hard to continuously come up with brand new never done before stories, so this is only a small critique, but it's been done before.Overall though, we loved Elemental. It's a fantastic choice to watch with the familykids. It didn't feel like anything was forced, there's good jokes for both parents and kids, it has an emotional ending, and the movie does do a good job of getting its message across. It's a Pixar romantic comedy movie and it does what it set out to do. It won't change the world, but it's got a good message.We recommend this movie 100% if you're a fan of family friendly animation, or Disney movies in general. IMDb has this at a 7.1 but collectively we give this an 810.TLDR - With a few lows, we still loved elemental and feel it's a great movie to watch with the family on movie night! Catch it when it comes to streaming! 810.",20

A lot of Disney movies suck now but this one is the best, but I wish they would have shown more of the other elements than Fire and Water and the plot of the story was really good, the main common goal within the elements are perfect. If anybody dislikes this movie they're crazy with all the movies that came out and are 8 to 10 rated that were actually 4 stars this should not be rated 7 it needs to be 8 to 9 stars. The creativity was the best , it kinda reminds me of zootopia. The jokes were amazing my favorite is the mom her personality was so relatable. I would recommend to anybody.",1
209,210,4.0,7.0,FranklyOdd,2023-06-29,"(A little bit of spoilers)
A 200-million-dollar romantic comedy. Very bold for Pixar, considering one would expect a budget like this would be utilized for a more ""revolutionary, standard-breaking"" type plot.Elemental is a flick that I believe is entertaining enough for anyone to enjoy, however is not a movie for everyone. Those who will be invested in cheesy, wholesome forbidden-romance will dig this treat.Firstly, I want to address that Pixar has always been advancing its animation to new heights, particularly with their first film involving animate elements that operate on a completely different set of rules for physics. No matter how Pixar now lacks the factor of unexpectedness when it comes to hitting the bullseye for outstanding animation and art direction, I won't ever stop in applauding the animation and art team for all their work. I do think Ember and Wade could use much more creative and eye-popping clothing choices though.Now for the plot. It follows a troubled young adult fire girl Ember Lumen, who eventually meets and starts falling for ""go-with-the-flow"" water guy Wade Ripple. Over the course of the movie, Ember's strong filial loyalty to her immigrant, less-than-rich parents and a carefree life of her own authority with Wade and the outside world of elements both tug for her heart's attention from either direction. And she makes her own decision at the end.Since our main protagonists are young adults and the topic of this movie is romance, the film does choose a more conventionally mature topic to deal with, and executed it in accordance, fairly well if I say so myself! Ember was still a much likeable, 3-dimensional main protagonist, however so the writing feels a little wonky at times. Wade, the main deuteragonist, likewise was also just as likeable past how he initially behaved. Really little in this movie felt ""empty"" or ""bland"" to me.I had little issue with the pacing for the most part, aside from the aftermath of Ember and Wade's argument(s) which was barely given focus or serious attention.The world-building could use more emphasis for what a fascinating concept a habitat of fire, water, earth and air is. It was still good, in the department of merely focusing on the biological interaction between fire and water.Elemental sets itself up as a forbidden-romance serving fundamentally strong ties to a race allegory that's all but nowhere to be found and rather shoved under the carpet for the majority of the movie. A shame as it is proven later on that it is biologically (or chemically) possible that fire and water, believed to be so apparently destructive towards one another, can indeed mix through mutual relationship.What I think this movie primarily could be better isn't in what it COULDN'T do, but what it DIDN'T do. Elemental has a runtime of around 1 and a half hour cutting out the credits, and its influence is apparent in what it lacked. Most prominently of this section, Wade could've been a more floppy, less ""smoothened-out"" version of himself, an actual developable deuteragonist. He would have been more 3-dimensional, convincing, and riveting this way. Gale and Clod were missed potential, barely in or serving anything to the movie's plot. Most glaringly, I expected them to be utilized for as aforementioned, the movie's largely-missing race allegory. The side characters have to take the backseat to the important forefront plot however even with this, I don't feel the side characters that were introduced get nearly enough screentime or attention. Many questions about the world's past or how the other elements work are left unsatisfyingly unanswered, or unaddressed.For what it's worth, Elemental is a predictable but enjoyable experience that carried itself out well. It isn't a ""revolutionary"" story but shouldn't be expected to be one, even as it's a feature to crave from a Pixar film. But there is care I see in this film that isn't quite as noticeable as much as a ""revolutionary"" story is. Make what you will of it.Is it better than Zootopia, the movie everyone says it's trying to clone? Elemental is quite different from Zootopia in fact, and no, I will prefer Zootopia over it.Do I think it's a terrible film? Nowhere close. However it doesn't stick well with the solidified ""Pixar"" standard.I initially had no idea for the number of stars I'm going to give this film. I started with something lower, since I'm no big fan of romcoms to begin with. But I want to look at it through a perspective of its intentions and what it was trying to achieve within its own identity. This is what I believe is the right way to go, so I raised the score. I'd have to give this movie a 6.5 stars, if I had the option to do so.",0

It was a funny situation. I don't think it was a bad movie. But it was a bit of a disappointment. Because I wanted to see multiple elements, but they are focused on the love of two elements. Fire and water. It wasn't ridiculous, but I think it could have been better.

219,220,5.0,10.0,olivialovesicecream,2023-06-27,"Wow, this may be one of my favorite Pixar films. Great voice actors and a simple yet sweet storyline. Everything you would expect from Pixar.Let us address the elephant in the room: the animation. The animation is top-notch. The characters flow so smoothly. The city-building is really neat, similar to Zootopia. Pixar spared no expense, and it's definitely worth it.The storyline is kind of a typical opposites-attract love story, but the concept of using literal polar opposites (fire and water) is very unique. Other elements (no pun inteded) are also weaved into the story, like how Ember's torn between her relationship with her family and her relationship with Wade. I also like how it wasn't a love-at-first-sight thing. It was gradual. The main storyline is simple, but makes the story not souly focused on the love part, but contributes to it. I liked the storyline very well.But my favorite element (okay, I'm done!) was the characters! I didn't really connect, per say, to any of the characters, but I loved them all! But let's just talk about the two main lovebirds.Ember Lumen is a ""fiery young woman"" who has a hot temper. She really wants to please her father by taking over the family shop. But this isn't really what she wants to do, but she is afraid to tell her father. Despite this, she is generally kind. But she is brought out of her shell by...Wade Ripple, a ""go-with-the-flow guy"" who is everything Ember's not, physically and mentally. He is my personal favorite character. He is just an average water guy, hopping around from job to job. Ah, and I love his family! So sweet! They do cry a lot though...But my favorite part of the movie was when Wade sacrificed himself for Ember... it was so bittersweet. And of course this is Pixar, so they had to bring him back, and I love how they played the Crying Game! I love it. But there were many other parts I loved as well.Overall this movie is wonderful, visually beautiful, and practically perfect in every way. I would highly recommend, 1010.",5
220,221,4.0,8.0,educunhaholanda,2023-06-27,"This movie is good. Nothing special but not a disaster either. There are no villains and the story is basically a cliché romance that many have seen in several other movies. However it's funny, the jokes are good and the plot is decent.I believe the marketing failed to sell this movie. From the trailers, it seems that the movie is adventure-themed, a generic Zootopia with elements, but in fact, it's a romantic comedy. Something that was only hinted at in the first teaser, which is not even a scene in the movie.For movies like these, I usually give a 7, but I'm giving this movie an 8 because I really liked the visuals of the characters and the environment. And watching it in 3D makes it even better, with elements much more vivid.It's not Pixar's best animation by far, but better than its latest disasters for sure.",1

Elemental is the most extraordinary animation film I've ever witnessed so far. It depicts so many valuable lessons throughout Ember and Wade's relationship (two distinctive elements) such as: ""Live for your own dreams instead of someone else's"".The animation is quite stunning to behold; fluid, expressive and diverse. I can tell Pixar had so much fun with it while pushing the envelope; such a delight to watch. The world drips with inventiveness and attention to detail; I wouldn't pass on living in Element City. I can't leave out Thomas Newman's music, too. This is the composer's fourth collaboration with Pixar (the first since Finding Dory) and his score doesn't disappoint; lovely, often hypnotizing, and always hits the right notes.Elemental an absolute triumph. The lovable characters and their emotional journeys tug at the heartstrings, leaving viewers captivated and deeply moved.

This is one of my favorite Pixar films. It's so beautiful. Go watch it. It's a amazing movie that needs a sequel to explore some stuff they didn't do here. Hey it's better than ""the flash"" and ""the little mermaid"" and even better than spider verse. If you want to support original animated films or original films in general then watch this.

Turns out however this is not what i expected but in the bad wayAs i expected the world is similar to Zootopia that is about diskrimination to a race. The main complication is either about the love story between ember and Wade or the ember's problem with her dad. The thing is i feel both complication is getting 50-50 of the screen time, but somehow the love story is like the only complication in this entire movie.For the love story, this complication get really huge of screen time, also ember constantly having uncontrolled emotion just like teenager and to make it worst they also kiss which don't really fit for ""kids"" movie.Ember's problem with her dad doesn't really dominant, the kind of problem that i don't really sympathy with, maybe a little bit in the beginning but from the middle part to the end, the love story just feel dominant for me.I think Its really worth to watch if you like the genre but obviously its not worth for kids or someone that expecting this movie like every other recent kids movie.",1
224,225,4.0,7.0,jaysanchu07,2023-06-26,"Elemental once again showcases the remarkable and dazzling visual touch, Pixar films are known for. As always, the studios meticulous attention to detail and praise worthy, imagination-driven animation stands front and center, in crafting a realistic world that audiences can get lost in. From the stellar personification of the elements, to the cleverly thought of and complementing Elemental City, the overall design is simply jaw dropping and convincing, consistent with the studios past offerings.Story-wise however, is where the film stagnates. Not to be mistaken, the immigrant centered, coming of age, breaking through barriers storyline does have its shining moments, but treads along the lines of overly familiar. The screenplay stumbles as well at times, producing blank faced reactions to some of its heavy handed scenes such as Embers family centered conflict. As for the romance, Pixar redeems itself, for fashioning an opposites attract love story, made charming by its fascinating character quirks and animation. Somehow, someway, this felt fresh.Overall, I found no surprise in critics underwhelmed responses to Elemental. It is however undeniable, that the film does enough, and if comparisons to Pixars early works can be avoided (a BIG if), deeper appreciation for Ember and Wades world is definitely in the horizon.
