There is really no reason to go see this film as it has lame characters, bland dialogue, unfunny jokes. And it's just really boring. And just like lightyear, this movie hold nothing to make you care or remember the film. Honestly there really isn't much to say about this film, other than it's proven to see how far pixar has fallen over the years. And it's sad when not 1, not 2, but 3 of there past films have been critical failures. If this isn't a slap in the face and a huge punch to the gut. To get your stuff together and turn this train wreck around.",13.0
1,2023-06-09,15.0,5.0,9.0,xeffy,"""Elemental"" takes you on an incredible journey through a bustling city where people of different elemental backgrounds live side by side. Ember and Wade truly embody the film's central message: that we're more alike than we realize. As Ember, a fiery young woman, and Wade, a laid-back guy, discover their shared humanity, the movie beautifully explores themes of unity, understanding, and the incredible power of connection.The world-building in ""Elemental"" is absolutely stunning. The city itself is a visual feast, with each element having its own distinct architecture and style. From skyscrapers covered in lush greenery to water slides and wind-powered homes, every detail immerses you in this vibrant and enchanting world.The film's portrayal of how the elements interact is both amusing and touching. Whether it's a water-being's sneeze causing grass to sprout or Ember's intense heat affecting others around her, these moments showcase the intricate relationships between the elemental residents. They provide a delightful blend of entertainment and insight into the film's underlying plot.While the hint of romance between Ember and Wade adds an extra layer of intrigue, ""Elemental"" is so much more than just a love story. It delves deep into Ember's personal journey as she navigates the city and tries to form meaningful connections. The character development is strong, and you can't help but cheer for Ember and Wade as they face their challenges and strive to make a positive impact on their community.With its breathtaking visuals, compelling storyline, and heartfelt message, ""Elemental"" is a true cinematic gem. This film will captivate you, make you reflect, and leave you inspired. It's a must-watch. Prepare yourself for a captivating story that reminds us of the incredible strength found in unity and the beauty of finding common ground in a diverse world.",47.0

It's an adorable, heartfelt family film about the immigrant experience told in a way kids can understand, an animated romantic comedy anyone can enjoy.It's a unique take on a love story as old as time - 2 people from 2 very different worlds meet and suddenly everything changes. They start to see the world from a new perspective, learn about and fall in love with a culture they had never known before. Wade and Ember represent so many people who live in diverse places and are immersed in different cultures.I'm from a mixed family and I grew up in NYC so this film touched my heart in ways I can't adequately articulate. I don't think I've ever seen this kind of story told in a way children can understand - sometimes when 2 people who live in a place where people come from all over the world, you meet someone you never would have met before and you fall in love.I hope people take the time to watch this movie and I can't wait to see what Peter Sohn works on next.",46.0

The story is well structured and the characters are well developed. The music is cute, the animations are high quality, of course the CGI is also high quality, the character design is cute.The film is pleasant to see, I recommend seeing it with the whole family, it's not a heavy film and it flows well. It also has some basic subjects dealt with intelligently, without going overboard. It's not the movie of the year, but it's definitely a cute movie that kids will enjoy, for sure. Very cute, take the kids to see it.",32.0
7,2023-06-15,8.0,4.0,7.0,ajacayen-08856,"Alongside the release of The Flash, I have never been anticipated to watch a movie in theaters again. And with Elemental, it has proven to give me a great time watching it and has, in a way, revived my love for Pixar films.Ember Lumen was easily the best part of the film because of her struggles in controlling her temper. Her inner conflict between chasing your dreams vs. Family has been a repetitive theme shown in Disney classics but this one hits home for me. Even if my parents were not immigrants, I was able to connect with where she and her family are coming from.For a while, Wade Ripple was an annoying character because of him being a soft guy and crying too much - but that's what also made me like him a lot after watching it. Also, he delivers such romantic lines to Ember that did make me feel kilig at those moments.Speaking of kilig, their romance, while at first did not sit well with me on how they sparked, their pairing was so cute and adorable that it's hard for me to not ship them. And in that relationship, Ember learns a lot about trying things out first and understanding people's differences to reach on a common ground which I thought was pulled off really great.In addition to understanding differences, I loved how they featured the sides of fire and water in order to see how the two families of both Ember and Wade react to their romance - and it was also very relatable for those showing their loved one to the family.Of course, the animation should be talked about because what Pixar has done was absolutely great. With how fire, water, air and wind was animated to such perfection, it is without a doubt deserved to be nominated for Best Animated Feature - even if it's not as amazing as Across the Spider-Verse.As for the story, the first act sets up a lot things very quickly which may need second viewing to get used to it. As it progressed towards the second act, Ember's relationship with both her family and Wade was easily the best part. And how the film wrapped up in its final act, while cheesy, I felt for Wade and Ember's relationship by the end and made me feel great watching it.Overall, it felt great watching Elemental and it is indeed one of those movies that if it comes out on Disney+, I am definitely going to check it out. But I still encourage animation lovers to watch this on the big screen because it's the better experience to enjoy this film.",31.0
8,2023-06-16,1.0,3.0,6.0,benjaminskylerhill,"Elemental has several obvious glaring problems. For one thing, the attempt to make the elements' differences an overt metaphor for raceculture is shallow and misplaced at best most of the time.The story's themes and plot itself are about as worn-out and tired as the art of the story itself. Not a single new idea is really explored at this level.And, at the more surface level, the film's visuals vary greatly in quality: the environments are gorgeous, colorful, and vibrant, while the character designs appear haphazard, thrown together, and honestly kind of ugly.But where this film shines-and I mean REALLY shines, surprisingly-is in the writing of its characters.Ember and Wade are instantly distinct, understood, and likeable. They both grow tremendously and at a consistent pace. They are 110% the reason to see this film. I got emotionally wrapped up in their lives and desires in a way that I've only felt in Pixar's best films. This is the sole great achievement of Elemental.The one other thing I can praise is the sound design and the musical score-both of which are largely powerful and memorable.Maybe it's that my expectations were on the floor going into this, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Maybe wait to catch it on streaming, but don't write it off completely.",35.0
9,2023-06-17,2.0,2.0,3.0,truthisuncouth,This is a worn out story of recycled material that will bore children. The characters are one dimensional. The scenes are tepid and unexciting. The use of elements to convey human emotion is a nice idea but the execution is not good. The animation was okay but not unique. Certainly nothing to go out of your way for. The depth of the character development seems shallow. The musical score is middling. The editing is choppy. The sound mixing is fair. The scene to scene progression is awkward and the run time is longer than one might expect from the material in the movie. My overall impression is that it can be missed.,64.0

12,2023-06-20,10.0,2.0,3.0,Father_RIPs,"Elemental is bad, it's as simple as that. There were a few key issues that are easy to pinpoint, but overall the reason this failed is much more abstract. I think the main issue is that Pixar got in way over their heads. They had this story idea but no real means to animate it, so once they figured out a way to animate it (using 151,000 computer cores), they then had to work around the confines of this massive animation project. And by all means, you can tell this was an issue; cutaways and transitions are awful throughout, and you can tell that the script is majorly rushed to get past this factor; It seemed lazy. Not one character takes a breath in this film before moving on to the next rushed, poorly-written line. Scene after scene with no real meaning and every story element (pun intended) that was supposed to elicit some type of emotional response was given to you in an unsolicited flashback that made no sense. And this created some cringeworthy backstory scenes and dialogue that came out of nowhere. It was quite possibly one of the worst films I have seen in a long time, and it's more heartbreaking that it came from Pixar.Now to be fair to what they've done here, the animation is beautiful, they created a really good-looking animated film, but there was no time to appreciate it due to quick cuts and pointless filler scenes. Once again, Disney and Pixar prioritized the wrong things, taking away from this beautiful feat of animation to create a sloppy pointless story.The voice acting was also sub-par, to say the least. Most of it was average and doesn't make you think twice, except for Ember (Leah Lewis), who really shined, seeming to give real emotion in her lines despite the awful writing. But Wade (Mamoudou Athie) is a different story. His voice was heartless, in my opinion. And again, this may be the script's fault more than the voice acting since Wade was such a boring character who wasn't given a name until halfway through the film (which is insane to think about). We were given a few glimpses of Wade's emotional backstory that could have potentially had some importance to the story, but then the credits roll, and you feel the same way about him at the end as you did in the beginning. He was annoying, and his arc was flatter than the voice acting given for him.I didn't go into this film thinking it was going to be good, but I thought it could be fun. I was proven wrong in a big way. Overall the only redeeming part is its animation which is overshadowed by its story issues. It's worth a watch for the animation alone, but should not be glorified for any other aspect of it (which seems to be what many are doing.",8.0

14,2023-06-22,55.0,4.0,8.0,andrewchristianjr,"A beautiful picture with a great parallel to immigration and a stunning coming of age story with self discovery and pursuit of personal ambitions. I genuinely think this is easily one of the most romantic movies from Pixar and fans of romantic comedies in general will be delighted. The movie is so undeniably sweet and heartfelt. All this boosted by the colorful and unique animation makes this a movie that is one of the better entries from the studio in the last few years. I don't think it is among the best of Pixar, but that is an enormous ask of a studio that has given us so many all-time classics.",0.0
15,2023-06-23,74.0,3.0,6.0,Taps06,"I came into Elemental expecting it to be a basic, but not badly told story. After watching it, I was right. It was pretty decent.The movie follows Ember Lumen planning to follow her family's footsteps, but in the processes meets Wade Ripple, a go-with-the-flow guy. Along they way they realize how much they have in common.Once again, average story, but nothing too bad. The characters are fine, the plot is fine, the visuals and score are amazing, but that's typically a Pixar given.I do think it's a really cool idea for the director to tell his own story through these elements, and I can definitely see the passion behind this film. It's decent, and I think it's worth watching at least once.",0.0

18,2023-06-26,223.0,4.0,8.0,paczkowskijohn,"Elemental is one of Pixar's Best films in years. Animation is gorgeous, Thomas Newmans score is excellent, Voice acting is consistently great, the romance is sweet and very heartfelt, Embers character arc is really solid and she is a very relatable character, and there are some good laugh lines. Lauv's song ""steal the show"" is also pretty great. The story line is familiar and some of the concepts go untapped or just are convoluted in a sense, but I don't care. This is one of my favorite Pixar films. It's so beautiful. Go watch it. It's a amazing movie that needs a sequel to explore some stuff they didn't do here. Hey it's better than ""the flash"" and ""the little mermaid"" and even better than spider verse. If you want to support original animated films or original films in general then watch this. You'll love it. Pixar gained a little bit of old Magic back. By the way, the Up Short ""carls date"" before the film is honestly nothing great but it's cute, silly, and has solid visuals.",26.0

Sure. It can get a little tired. But this telling of that story is sweet, funny, touching, bright, and really just a gorgeous design. I loved it from start to finish. You can tell me the same lovely story over and over again, especially if you change up some things and find ways to make it a little different. I love Peter Pan and will watch it any way someone wants to tell it. Some retellings will be good, some won't, but I think Elemental is a great way to tell this particular story.",0.0

I noticed our theater had a pretty diverse group of ages and family groups who all seemed to enjoy it as well.I watched with my 7 year old who (despite being out past bedtime and generally easily bored) stayed engaged the entire movie and came out excited to talk about it.

21,2023-06-29,208.0,4.0,8.0,9603Reviews,"Recently we went and watched Disney's ""Elemental"", and we've got a bit to say about it!First off, we both loved this movie! The worst thing about this movie is how little we saw about it before hand. ""Elemental"" centers around Ember, a fire elemental immigrant to element city, with a bit of a temper and a ton of pressure to save and take over the family business, and Wade, a water elemental who just so happens to also be an extremely emotional city code inspector.Elemental does very well bringing to light the challenges an immigrant familygroup faces in a new environment, while also making sure it's wrapped up in a cute animated rom-com. The other elements are afraid, hostile, or dismissive when it comes to the the fire district and its people,but it's evened out with the budding romance between your two main characters. It also does very well in showing how important unity is among different groups of people. The art and animation in this one are amazingly done as well! The characters, in our opinion, are all well animated, well designed, and unique enough in their own ways. The animation, as standard with Pixar, is 100% on point.Elemental, however, does lack in a select few areas. The side characters for the air and earth elements were all forgettable. Clod, Fern, Gale, and Lutz are all forgettable. The main characters and their families are well done and fleshed out. But they miss the mark on the backup characters. The story is also, nothing we've never seen before. Obviously it's hard to continuously come up with brand new never done before stories, so this is only a small critique, but it's been done before.Overall though, we loved Elemental. It's a fantastic choice to watch with the familykids. It didn't feel like anything was forced, there's good jokes for both parents and kids, it has an emotional ending, and the movie does do a good job of getting its message across. It's a Pixar romantic comedy movie and it does what it set out to do. It won't change the world, but it's got a good message.We recommend this movie 100% if you're a fan of family friendly animation, or Disney movies in general. IMDb has this at a 7.1 but collectively we give this an 810.TLDR - With a few lows, we still loved elemental and feel it's a great movie to watch with the family on movie night! Catch it when it comes to streaming! 810.",20.0

It seamlessly weaves together the elements of adventure, mystery, and fantasy, taking viewers on an unforgettable journey. The narrative is both engaging and thought-provoking, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film.One of the movie's standout features is its awe-inspiring visual effects.

The plot and love story was a little ""been there done that"" but I think the message of the movie was beautiful. It's biggest fault is that the writers didn't know it's audience though. This was clearly for an older audience that come from immigrant parents. Not everyone can relate to that and for those that don't, it can come off as preachy. The animation was lovely. The character of Wade is so adorable, you can't help but fall in love with him. Overall, the movie struck a cord with me and made me cry on a few occasions which isn't that easy to do.",1.0

26,2023-07-04,189.0,4.0,7.0,mrplotos,"Is this film worth watching? Absolutely, as per tradition, pixar hides within its products a message that it wants the more adult viewer to discover, and this is one of the most beautiful values that this production company has been offering for a very long time.On the other hand, I do not agree with those who say that Pixar has lost its magic... even if we are not talking about a masterpiece like Coco and Up, I still see a hint of magic.However, this general opinion should serve as a wake-up call for the production to ensure that this great magic can return in future masterpieces.Regarding the structure of the film... it's 1h 40 min that passes quickly to the viewer thanks to the editing style I liked as much as I liked the attention to detail. The overall stylistic choice didn't blow me away but it's still very acceptable!I'll conclude my thoughts with a scene that really pumped me up XD, the ""cyclone stadium"" scene where you could really feel the electrifying atmosphere inside, even from the cinema seats.Guys, keep supporting this production company that absolutely must not fade away!MRPLOTOS.",0.0
27,2023-07-05,186.0,4.0,7.0,jp_91,"The result of ""Elemental"" is a good movie but it could have been much better. The script touches on the already seen thousand times theme of being who you are, focused from an animated perspective on the elements, in addition to effectively adding the message of fair treatment towards immigrants. The animation is good but not spectacular, it lacked a spark to achieve something really great. The character design is simple. The voice work of the actors is well done. The cinematography is good and the musical score does its job. ""Elemental"" is packed with wonderful production but it could have been so much better.",0.0
28,2023-07-06,182.0,4.0,8.0,PedroPires90,"I know that 99% of the world disagrees with me, but this is my favourite animated film so far in 2023.The visuals are incredible, and they don't need to be too flashy or in your face. They just need to present an incredible level of realism in certain details (the water!) and the score (wow!) and soundtrack are pleasant surprises that always blend well with the story.Nevertheless, the great merit of Elemental lies in its two main characters and how they represent the depicted themes. Immigration, racism, prejudice, privilege, segregation, family, expectations, dreams, legacy, identity, friendship, love. It's such a wide and interesting array of themes, and it's amazing that the film does such a great job with all of them. This is a story that will certainly resonate much better with immigrants or those who experience certain types of discrimination. But it's a positive story, always hitting the right tone that makes us laugh and identify with its characters. There's an important subplot that isn't strong enough or even resolved in a satisfactory way, but it's easy to forgive that when we spend 100 minutes with a huge smile on our faces.Ember is a fantastic character and steals the show, encapsulating so many things and being so relatable. She's the one who makes this work so well, not only as a thematically important and entertaining film but also as a beautiful romantic comedy. It doesn't shy away from genre clichés, but it's cozy in the way it reaches its conclusions, never overdoing its preachiness and always with a lot of charm and cool elements.",0.0
29,2023-07-07,178.0,4.0,7.0,bm230199,Elemental was a sweet and heartwarming story and although it won't go down as one of Disney's greats it was still memorable. I think my favourite thing was the subtle themes of diversity and inclusivity throughout as well as the very relevant storyline of certain people being excluded from society simply for being different. It can work on many levels and I thought this movie would be an excellent way to introduce young children to these issues similar to how Inside Out was utilised. The main characters were sweet and the voice actors did a good job to give them vivid personalities. The animators did an excellent job as some scenes were just STUNNING and I loved how the fire characters weren't just orange but actually moved like a flame even when standign still. That must've been hard to annimate but they did any amazing job. To summarise: Visually stunning sweet story about the struggle of cast-out members of society.,4.0
30,2023-07-08,171.0,5.0,10.0,chris_rowe-881-168820,"I cannot for the life of me understand why people are so hateful towards things now, sometimes I just can't see how I'm seeing the same thing as them. I kind of understand why Disney do these films that tie into real world issues and I think it's an obligation to keep kids innocent and accepting which is their nature, the only reason of the negativity is how they get influenced, so I guess the people hating are the ones who don't like acceptance, inclusivity etc. I think it was mild, not too aggressive and handled well and sadly it's poignant because adults still behave awfully.The characters were great, I like how they used unknown people for the voices and I like how it's treating kids as mature and not making it babyish. The animation is perfect as always, the world is very similar to other Pixar films but there's kinda limited stuff to do with that. The underrated Ruby Gillman film had slightly better visuals but both were exceptional.If you've become so dead inside this seriously makes you score 0-510 then I feel sorry for you, I'm 36 and make and Disney will always be top notch.",4.0
31,2023-07-09,166.0,4.0,7.0,melonhulkhead,"Elemental has all of the components that make a movie a great watch: gorgeous visuals, solid voice acting, an impressive score and an engaging romance. Obviously it's Pixar so it's gonna excell with the animation and textures of this new large world to explore. The voice cast wasn't anything special but did a very good job with the (occasionally generic) script given to them. The music was also actually very good with a couple of pop songs we've all heard and a few new ones that fit the tone of the movie aswell.The romance was definitely the highlight of this movie. So the whole point is that both protagonists are from opposite communities and have the whole ""hedgehog effect"" (the closer they get the more they hurt eachother) obviously due to one being fire and the other water. This sounds very basic and not anything that unique yet I couldn't help actually feel engaged by their relationship with eachother. They're both fairly likeable characters with certain personalities that help create quite a fun level of chemistry. It also does feel quite natural with how they become more comfortable with eachother for the first half of the movie. I could see the argument that maybe it felt a little bit rushed but it still worked nonetheless. The only issue I had was their relationship was during the third act of the movie which had the cliche ""I love you but we shouldn't be together"" conflict. Obviously it made sense with the type of characters they were but the argument just felt completely out of nowhere which almost made my eyes roll.Also surprisingly the comedy was very good for the most part. Wade turned out to be hilarious and the line deliveries within these scenes were great. He also had a large amount of visual comedy which somehow got me laughing more than anything else. However outside of Wade the rest of the movie lacked with the comedic side. There were a couple of moments that made me chuckle with characters such as Ember and Wade's family but there wasn't really much else.One of the problems for me was the dialogue especially between Ember and Wade. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever heard but it felt so generic and sometimes cringeworthy during certain scenes.The story was also admittedly a bit all over the place. There were many times when we would go from one scene to another with little build up so it would feel quite unnatural and random. There were also entire scenes which just felt completely irrelevant even if stuff like the visuals or comedy was really good. There's a scene later in the movie where Wade and Ember are travelling around an area with really nice visuals but it just felt stretched out for the sake of ""looking good"". It did nothing for either of the characters and seemed to only be there to move on to the next scene.Characters were also a bit of a hit or miss. Really the only highlights are Ember, Wade, Ember's Dad and that's probably about it. Everyone else just kinda showed up and left in the next scene. Nobody else felt very relevant to the plot nor were they actually very entertaining to watch (outside of Wade's family who got out a few laughs). Even Wade, the secondary protagonist, didn't have that interesting of a character. Sure he was fun but he had a lack of depth.So to sum it up, Elemental is a pretty good romcom with great visuals and surprisingly good music. It had a somewhat generic (yet enjoyable) plot with few memorable characters outside of the 2 protagonists. 710 maybe a 6.510 but the animation was just that good.",0.0
32,2023-07-10,162.0,5.0,9.0,Elvis-Del-Valle,"Elemental is quite a different movie than anything Pixar has brought us before because of the animation and character style. It feels like a different movie, but it has that Pixar style of storytelling. It is a story of an ipossible romance that little bu little grows and leads Ember Lumen to discover that her task of taking her father's place is perhaps not what destiny has in store for her. Upon meeting Wade Ripple, Ember discovers much more about herself. The plot is simple, but it serves its purpose. The idea of using characters made up of the four most known elements makes the movie feel like something new that hasn't been done before. Even many of these characters make the film look surreal, adding the amazing animation that makes it visually masterful. The idea of an impossible romance between a woman of fire and a man of water gives the film a poetic touch. Ember's fire ends up being symbolic of her frustration and inner conflict. Wade's water becomes a symbolism of his sensitivity, and that is why it is not uncommon to see him cry. It is a couple made up of a conflicting woman and a sensitive man. Even the idea that the elements are not compatible becomes an allegory with respect to inequality, and it is more evident when seeing the distrust that Ember's father has towards the people of water. The plot has good potential to be a great love story, and if it had been a much more dramatic love story in the style of movies like Titanic or Our Fault in Our Stars, it would certainly have been an excellent romantic movie. Elemental is an enjoyable movie that derives from what is already known about Pixar, and that makes it a unique movie that deserves a chance. My final, unique and valid rating for this film is 910.",0.0
33,2023-07-11,161.0,4.0,7.0,quiqueperezsoler,"To say the world of Elemental is a not-so-subtle allegory of real life wouldn't be an overstatement. To say the themes and plot points explored in this movie diverted a bit of the typical rom-com and immigrant family struggles wouldn't be an oversimplification. I liked this movie, and I think everyone will too. What's not to like?The animation style is unique and virbrant, mixing 3D and 2D fitting the trend Spiderverse began; the characters are charming, the story endearing and the world stunning and.. a tad underdeveloped. I know what this movie is trying to do, it is attempting this mix between real-life allegory prejudices from Zootopia and metaphysical introspective foud in Inside Out. However, it fails at nailing what these two succeeded at doing:Zootopia made the effort to establish the pillars of how society worked. Surely the nature of the members of its society (animals) themselves explained most of the prejudices and ""class distinction"", but the environments and cities were explored in a montage to a certain extent to explore a bit how these different creatures lived together. Here, there are so many obvious questions unanswered that it becomes distracting. You don't need to explain every single rule of how the world works but you still have to establish the grounds for an understandable story. I know the director drew inspiration from his childhood and his parents childhood into the story, and that's why I like it, it feels personal, it feels like I'm being let into the past and the heart of someone who cares. That's why it's more frustrating when some elements presented weren't explored or developed enough to make sense out of everything. So many questions needed to establish the backstory of this world and family: what was this other place the father had to leave from? How is it connected to the Elemental City? Are they the first immigrant family in the Elemental city? Are each element a different race? Why did they move to an abandoned neighborhood, and why was it abandoned? If the world was an allegory of New York or America, why is there only one-sided racism towards fire? I know it makes sense when talking about elements but do other couples combine too? Can they? Will they? The story seems to have a lot of firsts that the setting (inspired by the modern day) doesn't correlate to, if this allegory of the world we live in was as 1 to 1 as the movie presents it to be; this idea becomes a bit anachronistic.If the fire people are seemingly the immigrants who are not given any help to settle in the Elemental society, are other elements being prejudiced against? And it is just unfortunate because I really believe there are some nuggets of good ideas but the script never takes any chances with it. In turn, every element becomes the most average version of itself: the rom com tropes feel retraced, the relationships father-daughter familiar and stereotyped, the family of the boyfriend somehow white-guilt-tripped.Not to mention the character arcs. Amber has so much potential in the first half of the movie, boyfriend is a bit annoying but his heart is in the right place. But this is Amber's story, mostly because the boyfriend never had any motivation outside his job and her, he is a blank slate, and that's okay because Amber is the main protagonist. And what a waste. And mostly, her emotional moments were robbed from her: We never saw that Amber wanted to do something other than owning her father's shop, we never knew she wanted to do glass sculpting until bf's mom told her she should do it, and even then she thought no other alternative is to be thought off, only choice is the store; we never saw a inner conflict of her finding her true calling, she just ""stumbled upon it"", and when it was time for her to be honest with her dad, it was her bf who robbed her of that confession, he forced her to tell him in the worst possible time (in a bad way); she should have confessed that herself, out of courage and with the hope that her dad would understand and respect her choice; not to mention her dad never really lears to accept water people, we only learn he accepts her choice of not taking care of the shop. He never has a heart to heart with the one member of the society who has proven him the water people may not be that bad.No only that, but during her entire upbringing, Amber was always shown excited to take care of the shop, we never thought she'd be intrigued in pursuing another career path, she went straight to what her father taught her. And then when we see she may not have the patience to deal with bad customers, this could have been a great opportunity to challenge her to be better. Or what I thought would actually happen, that her bf, who was shown to be good at expressing his feelings and hyping up people, would be the one with whom she would learn to cool down and not stress. The element's natural essence work wonders for this concept, she is fire so she can get irritated and blow up, but water is calming and soothing, he could have been the perfect element to combine with.Unfortunately, the story was too focused on the particular themes it wanted to explore, too personal to the artist to let us into the world they created. The world-building was lacking because the story and characters were more important, and that's fine, but then the world of the elements is wasted in its conceptual potential. This story would have been completely fine as a live action or in a world with people. Zootopia had an overarching plot, a detective case used as a backdrop of their story, a way for the main characters to explore every aspect of the society they had presented. And applying prejudices and commentary on our current society.The few emotional payoffs do not hit as hard because the story never delves into the intricaccies of any of the themes it presents. It tackles all of them well enough, but it feels shallow as we never get to see how certain prejudices or preconceptions affects the world around them. We learn the water people are actually the ""high class"" but we never see what the other elements are, and it's not like you can tell right away based on elemental hierarchy because there is no preestablished hierarchy like we can find in the Animal kingdom. The movie rushes through everything and never takes a moment to breath, to settle in the notions it establishes. If anything, the biggest emotional payoff was the salute betwen daughter and father at the end, harkening back to the flashback scene with the dad. It's just that movies like Turning Red have represented this aspect of mix-cultures better than in this movie,The movie doesn't know what it wants to be, it starts being a ""passing the baton"" from father to daughter where she must prove she is up to the task, then finds a conflict in that she must calm down in order to do a good job and then she worries about fixing the water fissure so that her dad doesn't learn that the pipes bursting was her fault even though it wasn't her fault because it was the water dam who was at fault so it wasn't really her fault; and yet later suddenly is told she is good at doing glassware and she suddenly decides to leave and.... I just, don't understand the correlation between any of the resolutions of this story. I know on paper they make sense how things ""could"" be connected, but we never see them connect.Again, my conclusion to this movie is, I applaud PIXAR for not doing a sequel and creating a new style and world; it says a lot about their capacity to create new worlds and the animation is amazing; it's just that the story retreaded a lot of familiar beats, never trying to tell something new or use its unique world to flesh out new ideas and concepts. I can see the story had personal significance to the director and I'd love to see more of these sort of personal stories and unique perspectives about society; just make sure you also deliver an impactful climax and emotionally resonating but also well-fleshed out pay-offs. But definitely this is the better path for a better PIXAR.",1.0
34,2023-07-12,157.0,5.0,10.0,ergo-58534,"Elemental is a beautiful and charming animated film from Disney and Pixar that tells the story of Ember and Wade, two elements of fire and water who fall in love despite their differences. The film is set in Element City, a vibrant and diverse metropolis where elements of air, earth, water and fire coexist and work together. Ember is a fiery and adventurous woman who lives in Firetown, a district full of warmth and energy. Wade is a calm and gentle man who lives in Watertown, a district full of tranquility and harmony. When Wade accidentally floods a convenience store owned by Ember's father, Bernie, he meets Ember for the first time and sparks fly between them. However, their relationship faces many challenges, such as their families' disapproval, their incompatible lifestyles, and the dangers of mixing fire and water. Will they be able to overcome these obstacles and find happiness together?Elemental is a delightful and touching film that celebrates the themes of diversity, acceptance, and love. The film is directed by Peter Sohn, who previously helmed The Good Dinosaur, and written by Sohn, John Hoberg, Kat Likkel, and Brenda Hsueh. The film features an amazing voice cast, including Leah Lewis as Ember, Mamoudou Athie as Wade, Ronnie del Carmen as Bernie, Shila Ommi as Cinder, Ember's mother, Wendi McLendon-Covey as Gale, Wade's boss, Catherine O'Hara as Brook, Wade's mother, Mason Wertheimer as Clod, Ember's earth neighbor, and Joe Pera as Fern, an overgrown city bureaucrat. The film also boasts a stunning animation style that brings Element City to life with vivid colors, textures, and details. The film showcases the unique characteristics of each element, such as the fluidity of water, the brightness of fire, the solidity of earth, and the lightness of air. The film also uses clever visual metaphors to illustrate the emotions of the characters, such as Ember's hair changing color according to her mood, or Wade's body evaporating when he is nervous. The film also has a wonderful score by Thomas Newman that captures the mood and tone of each scene.Elemental is a masterpiece of animation that deserves 10 stars out of 10.",2.0

A poor plot line, forced jokes whereby punchlines were repeated numerous times throughout the film, and a general sense of ""why bother?"" - not a film that will be remembered in the history books. There were also a variety of plot holes and unexplained plot points that weren't followed up throughout.They said the short film ""Carl's Date"" which shows beforehand is a nice visit back to the Up universe, although again not game changing or memorable in any convincing way.Disney are rapidly falling behind their competition and I would have expected this film to head straight to Disney+.",1.0

I don't think anyone in the theater liked it because as soon as the first credit rolled, everyone bolted for the exit.

41,2023-07-19,137.0,5.0,9.0,tommastaldi,"Critics that say this movie ""struggles to ignite"" and is conceptually flawed to the core which makes it impossible to enjoy, did not watch the same movie I did. I wouldn't put it up there with the absolute best Pixar movies (Wall-e will always and forever be my number 1), but saying this movie is downright bad just highlights your blandness and stupidity.1) The core concept is not the only thing that matters in a movie. Cars has a meh concept, but it's still an incredibly enjoyable movie with an important message, as well as being a love letter to americana. Elemental's concept is flawed, true, but the way it is executed makes the mistakes and inconsistencies much easier to ignore.2) The romance is virtually flawless and is just SO compelling and enjoyable. It had been so long since we had a Disney-Pixar movie focus primarily on romance, and this was the perfect movie to resuscitate the romance category by making it the most thought out and realistic romance we ever saw in a Pixar movie.3) The animation is godly. Period.4) Even the weakest part of the movie, the firetown flood, is still used to develop the blossoming romance between Ember and Wade to its final step: them becoming an actual couple.5) This movie's portrayal of discrimination is surprisingly similar to real life, with fire people being submitted to discrimination, violence, segregation, microaggressions, and racial slurs, all in a way that feels grounded in the movie's universe.6) The portrayal of different cultures and cultural fusions is so good. Fire people have an entirely different language, they have their own rituals and religions. Water people (the most privileged in Element City) also have a well thought-out culture. Air people have an entire sport dedicated to them only, and all elements are free to attend. When Wade waters down the Kol-nuts (to the outrage of Ember's father Burnie) because it makes them easier to eat, you can see the real life parallel in westernised asian foods, which are made more palatable to western palates despite being bland or inedible by eastern standards.This movie was made with care, love, passion, and it comes out as incredibly enjoyable.

But the story...eh. Really nothing new here. Feels like they took a bunch of tropes, mushed them together and the it against the wall to see what would stick. Immigration issues, family expectations, racism, poverty, cross cultural mixing...everything is here. You keep wondering where the story is going to land. None of it really explored anything in depth and the story felt slow in the beginning and flat at the end. I can see why there wasnt as much hype around this movie.",0.0

Needless to say, fire is not the most popular but they resolve to open their shop selling all things smoked, toasted, burnt, and red hot! It's an old building, though, and when one day the pipes give birth to the local, watery, buildings inspector ""Wade"" she discovers that they have no planning permission for their business and that he is going to have to report them. What now ensues is, sadly, a rather unimaginative series of escapades as she must track him down and stop him - and the authorities - from closing down the family's flaming enterprise. The animation is characterful and top notch - and the story certainly had potential, but somehow the thing just becomes a bit of a cheesy romance all too quickly. A lot more fun could have been had demonstrating just how incompatible the four - air, earth, water and fire - can be when mixed together; or - indeed - how symbiotic they can be, but the emphasis and the dialogue focusses just a bit too much on ""Ember"" and ""Wade"" and I am afraid that I rather lost interest. It's colourful and vibrant, there is some entertaining action with plenty of pyrotechnics and is worth a watch, but it will look just as good on the television and doesn't live up to the hype, sorry.",0.0
